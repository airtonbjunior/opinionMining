The full tagger software package is licensed as GPL version 2.

src/ -- All original code we've written -- the files in src/ with one
exception below -- we license under the Apache License version 2.0. However,
we have several GPL'd dependencies that we include in this package, which,
as we understand it, force the full package to be GPL.

src/cmu/arktweetnlp/impl/OWLQN.java -- is licensed GPL, originally from the
Stanford POS Tagger version 2010-05-26.

lib/stanford-postagger-2010-05-26.jar -- license GPL.

lib/posBerkeley.jar -- licensed Apache 2.0 (see below).

lib/trove-3.0.0a5.jar -- licensed LGPL.

(There are many more libraries used in the released version, that have their
own licenses and not listed here.)

... It is possible to remove the GPL'd dependencies, which are somewhat
minimal, but we have not done so at this time. We suspect it won't matter
for the vast majority of use cases, but would be interested in hearing from
you if otherwise.
