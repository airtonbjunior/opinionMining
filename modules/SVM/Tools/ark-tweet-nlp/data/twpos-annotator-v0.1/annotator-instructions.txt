TWEETNLP POS ANNOTATOR INSTRUCTIONS

(This assumes the annotation platform and input data have been set up 
as described in the setup instructions.)

0. Obtain or create a URL for a batch of items to annotate.
   Navigate to that URL in Firefox 3.6+.
   
The interface should display numbered text snippets ("items"). Initial 
POS tags may be present in gray above the tokens.

1. For each item,

 a) Determine whether the text is valid. 

   If there is a problem with the item, indicate this via the drop-down 
   on the left. You may consult the metadata for the item by clicking the 
   "Metadata" button.
   
 b) If the text is valid, look for tagging errors. 
   
   To correct a token's label, click to select it and type a new label. 
   If you enter something other than the original tag, it will appear in red.
   If you are unsure of the correct tag, enter "?".
   
   You may also use Tab/Shift+Tab or the left and right arrow keys to change 
   the currently selected token.
   
2. When you are done with a page of items, click the "Submit Query" button 
   at the bottom. This will add your annotations to an output file on the 
   server and display the next page of items.
   
3. When you have completed the last page of the batch of annotations 
   specified by the URL, a completion message will be displayed.
