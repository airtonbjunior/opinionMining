CMU ARK Twitter Part-of-Speech Tagger v0.3
http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/TweetNLP/

Basic usage
===========

Requires Java 6.  To run the tagger from a unix shell:

    ./runTagger.sh examples/example_tweets.txt

The tagger outputs tokens, predicted part-of-speech tags, and confidences.
See:

    ./runTagger.sh --help

We also include a script that invokes just the tokenizer:

    ./twokenize.sh examples/example_tweets.txt

You may have to adjust the parameters to "java" depending on your system.

Information
===========

Version 0.3 of the tagger is much faster and more accurate.  Please see the
tech report on the website for details.

For the Java API, see src/cmu/arktweetnlp; especially Tagger.java.
See also documentation in docs/ and src/cmu/arktweetnlp/package.html.
