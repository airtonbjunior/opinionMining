software $ neg $ I have read the installation instructions for both NIS 2004 and NAV 2004 prior to installation, but still ended up with the same result...junk software.
Norton products $ neg $ But if I installed either one of these Norton products, neither works after installation?
McAfee Anti-Virus 8 $ neg $ It can not be the computer or the owner, since I purchased McAfee Anti-Virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems.
Norton $ neg $ I have used Norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years, the software has gotten more and more disgraceful.
Norton $ neg $ I am glad that I do not work for Norton.
Installation $ neg $ After 4 attempted installs, I have finally given up.
NIS $ neg $ During install, NIS would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so.
Manual shutdown $ neg $ The MS scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar, over and over(up to 1 hr, I then shut it down and used GOBACK).
product $ neg $ The 1 time it did install, it did not work and had errors, I used the unistall NIS icon and it properly removed itself.
Norton $ neg $ I have never had this problem with any other software on my computer.
NIS 2003 $ pos $ NIS 2003 worked like a charm last year.
Norton $ neg $ Being a past Norton customer, I consider this to be a slap to my face.
installed $ neg $ Buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer.
Norton $ neg $ Norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products, but with this one, they have fallen off the cliff.
product $ neg $ As a loyal customer of Norton/Symantec products, I purchased Internet Security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product (and hence the one star rating).
program $ neg $ Yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet.
antispam function $ pos $ The latest of Internet Security has antispam function that is helpful because I has received a mountain of those these days.
updates $ neg $ Other than that it is all the same except the new updates.
Symantec softwares  $ pos $ But that is good for me because Symantec softwares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers.
scandisk $ neg $ So far I haven't had so much complaints except that I still haven't mastered how to scandisk when using Internet Security.
product $ neg $ Too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time.
suite $ neg $ Sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches.
speed $ pos $ I'm not sure why all the bad reviews, my computer isn't especially slowed down and I have Win'98.
speed $ pos $ Sure, it slows it down a little, but that's expected.
Semantic $ pos $ Perhaps Semantic could work out the efficiency a little, but these reviews are highly exagerated... I would ask what else these people are running on their computers(?)
NIS2004 $ neg $ Norton Internet Security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations.
installation $ neg $ This product has virtually all the same installation problems.
product $ neg $ For purposes of clarity, here is my review from that product,edited to be appropriate for this product, since, for the most part, they share many of the same problems.
SystemWorks $ pos $ This is the fourth version of SystemWorks and the second version of Internet Security that I have used and it has always been a favorite.
antivirus $ pos $ The antivirus feature is phenomenal, and is regularly updated.
antivirus $ pos $ I think their antivirus software was one of, if not the best, on the
Internet Security 2004 $ neg $ This version of Internet Security 2004, is beyond hope.
install $ neg $ They are a royal pain to install, and don't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all.
installation $ neg $ The biggest problem is the installation.
installed $ neg $ Also if you do manage to get it installed, any problems with LiveUpdate or with System Works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating Internet Security.
product $ neg $ I've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far, and I've not to get either product working properly.
installation $ neg $ First, it serious, serious installation problems.
install $ neg $ Back in May 2004, when I first reviewed this, it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run.
LiveUpdate $ neg $ Almost from the beginning, LiveUpdate would not function.
updates $ neg $ First, it failed whenever connecting to get updates.
LiveUpdate $ neg $ When I finally got it working, it only worked properly for many a month.
components $ neg $ The next problem was that it didn't recognize all the installed components, so it would not update them, most notably and importantly, virus definitions.
functions $ pos $ Once installed, however, some of the functions do work OK (Disk Doctor, One Button Checkup, and WinDoctor).
faster $ pos $ These tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions, and I found the menu to be much more navigable.
LiveUpdate $ neg $ But this doesn't make up for it's innumerable other short-comings, the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with LiveUpdate.
installs $ neg $ The other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of Norton SystemWorks before you installs this.
removal program $ neg $ Warning! The Windows "remove program" feature does not do a good job of this, and neither does Norton's own removal program.
fragments $ neg $ A lot of "fragments" were left in the Registry, and it the Norton system folders.
remove $ pos $ Their website had a download that helped remove those, although I had to manually remove a good number of files from the "Programs" directory.
install $ neg $ If you have an older version of "Internet Security" installed, you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with SystemWorks install.
remove $ neg $ You also need to go in and MANUALLY remove many Symantec files from the REGISTRY.
products $ neg $ As of October, 2004, these products are NOT working and I'm ready to demand a refund from Symantec.
functionality $ neg $ I just uninstalled SystemWorks and Internet Security for at least the fifth time due to funtionality issues.
reinstall $ neg $ Once again it won't reinstall, even with online and email assistance from Symantect Technicians.
version 2004 $ neg $ The best thing to do with this version, is to leave it on the store shelf. It doesn't work, and will cost you an enormous amount of your time, not to mention your hard earned dollars.
Symantect products $ neg $ Personally, I may never buy Symantect products again.
product $ neg $ Avoid this product at all costs.
2004 edition $ neg $ There are some highs to the 2004 edition, but mostly lows.
program $ neg $ The program brings more problems than a virus, albeit not as major problems, just not what you expect for 70 bucks.
support $ neg $ I had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the Norton firewall vs. the windows firewall, and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because I did not have a "customer priority ID number."
priority ID $ neg $ Then when I went to Norton's website to obtain a priority ID number per the instructions I had been given, I couldn't find a way to get one.
support $ neg $ So I e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question, and got a reply which was totally unresponsive (it looked as though they didn't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs).
Norton $ neg $ And, when you think about it, it's insulting that Norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase, whether on the phone or online (what if your computer is down?), should have equal priority.
memory usage $ pos $ Norton's memory usage on systems with 512 MB is very low.
memory usage $ pos $ I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.
update $ pos $ Both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together.
update $ pos $ You won't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks.
visual backtracking $ pos $ The best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking.
product $ neg $ Stay away from this product!
2004 $ neg $ I don't know what's happened to Norton, but 2004 is absolute garbage.
support $ neg $ The customer support is pathetic.
Norton internet security $ neg $ I have found too many bugs in Norton Internet Security Professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience.
product $ neg $ This product is absolutely not ready for release.
slow $ neg $ It is buggy, slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user.
product $ neg $ I am an IT professional and have used Norton for years, but this product is a complete and utter dud.
Internet Security $ neg $ It's a rip off if one buys Norton Internet Security and antivirus.
internet security $ neg $ Nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software.
parental controls $ neg $ Even though I have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer.
firewall $ neg $ Now in October,2004, the firewall said I couldn't OK anymore software to use the internet because its full.
capacity $ neg $ Im at full capacity!!!! I called Symantic and they said they don't know why but I should get Tech's Support at $35/hr to help!! I did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes untill I hung up!
product $ neg $ So, DON'T buy this or upgrade.
2004 version $ neg $ If you currently own the 2003 version, and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version, don't.
activation process $ neg $ There is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedius activation process, and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive.
product $ neg $ If you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product, save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version.
Norton program $ neg $ From day one, we've had hangups, crashes, glitches, continual reboots, LONG shutdowns due to "ccApp.exe" program running which is a Norton program.
Norton $ neg $ Long reboots due to Norton taking FOREVER  to boot.
memory usage $ neg $ We constantly got "Windows Virtual Memory Low" error messages popping up follwed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes.
support $ neg $ Norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer.
support $ neg $ Norton support is completely pathetic.
HOME VERSION $ neg $ DO NOT BUY ANY HOME VERSION OF NORTON ANYTHING.
Corporate Edition $ pos $ We were able to obtain a Norton Corporate Edition of Antivirus only (no firewall or utilities) and so far it's great.
Corporate edition $ pos $  I've used the Corporate edition at work without any problems ever.
Corporate edition $ neg $ If we had been unable to obtain the Corporate edition, we would NOT have purchased another Norton 2004 or 2005 home version anything.
Norton Internet/AV 2004 $ neg $ Our Norton Internet/AV 2004 was terrible right from the get go, so I'd think that if SytemWorks is ok now, it should remain ok.
corporate $ pos $ By the way, I use the Norton 2003 Corporate at work with absolutely no trouble.
professional version $ pos $ Likewise, I've heard Norton 2004 PROFESSIONAL version is fine too.
home version $ neg $ Just the home version of Norton Internet/AV has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with.
work $ neg $ I am an advanced computer user, so I cannot even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work!
program scan $ neg $ Seems the "program scan" feature did NOT find the EXE file for Outlook!
support $ neg $ Like most of their solutions (which first blame other applications for errors), the tech persons line was that this was probably a Microsoft error - it was NOT.
Symantec $ neg $ It was a Symantec error.
update $ neg $ After a recent update, I can no longer open more then 1 browser window.
support $ neg $ I've searched the program and their online tech support (worthless) and have found no solutions.
products $ neg $ This is definitely one of those products, especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit.
NIS 2004 $ pos $ I've been using NIS 2004 for about 2 months and it works well.
options $ neg $ Some of the options are confusing, especially when the popup warnings occur, but I've had no problems with intrusions.
intrusion $ pos $ Norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from.
popup blocker $ neg $ The popup blocker and anti-spam are bonuses.
Product $ neg $ Product is OK; however, despite the fact that I followed the rebate instructions explicitly, I am being denied the rebate because the processing agency incorrectly claims I did not send in proof of ownership of a previous product.
nstalling $ pos $ I didn't have any major problems installing this software.
components $ neg $ The only problem I had was a few components didn't quite load correctly upon startup, but a reboot fixed the problem.
working $ pos $ Anyhow, this software is working fine and no problems since I installed it two weeks ago.
installation $ neg $ I give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user.
installation $ neg $ If you experience problems with installation, you can visit symantec's website, click the support tab, click the 'home or home office support' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the Norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it.
installation $ neg $ Can't get easier than that!
spam $ neg $ I already knew something was wrong, because much of the Spam I've seen in the past six months was from resellers of Norton products.
install $ pos $ Mine installed no problem (but I DID uninstall my Norton Anti-Virus 2002 & Personal Firewall 2002 first).
work $ pos $ Seems to work great.
NIS 04 $ neg $ I read many reviews on Norton I.S. 2004 from a variety of sources (Cnet, Amazon, message boards) and came to the conclusion that NIS 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update.
booting $ neg $ Booting up my computer took forever!!!
blocking $ neg $ Then, my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone.
blocking $ neg $ My file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites.
Tech Line $ neg $ Again, every review written about the Tech Line is true...after waiting close to 45 minutes I finally spoke to a rep.
tech $ neg $ After telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program (which I had already done)...
tech $ neg $ They didn't know what the problem could be.
support $ neg $ I did it and it was worse the second time around...unbelievable.
Tech $ neg $ Basically, I ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the Tech Help.
unstalling $ neg $ Unfortunately, it does not give you the option of unstalling (or uninstalling) them individually.
components $ neg $ You can "disable" some of the individual components, but don't be fooled--they're still there and running.
Norton AntiSpam $ neg $ Although I disabled Norton AntiSpam, it is still there.
product $ pos $ This did manage to cut the number of popups during start-up from 4 down to 2.
popups $ neg $ But those 2 come up every time.
Norton $ neg $ Next, the big reason not to buy ANY Norton product:  If there's a problem with it, Norton charges $30 to even tell them about it.
charge $ neg $ Sure they say if it's their fault you won't get charged, but THEY are the ones who get to decide whether it's their fault.
NIS  $ pos $ While it didn't have all the features I would have liked, it was better than anything else I could find at the time.
installing $ neg $ The problems I had installing Norton extended way beyond what Symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with.
install $ neg $ When I purchase software, I NEVER want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry!
Spam killer $ pos $ Also, with one click you can help train your spam killer.
wizard $ pos $ And the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my LAN.
download $ neg $ I downloaded this set from Norton, and within minutes my Internet connection failed and my PC was almost dead due to registry problems from the download.
help $ neg $ Their site offers no live help at all.
service $ neg $ I tried to call Norton, and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for Non-tech Customer Service (tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of MUZAC) or they have a $30 tech-support number.
cost $ neg $ Who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95? (I also bought the back-up CD).
support $ neg $ I finally got a free support number for Norton through my ISP support staff, but waited an hour or more for a voice.
refund $ neg $ They said they would refund all the money, but a month later, they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to "handle" and ship a CD? --and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails.
product $ neg $ This is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support.
support $ neg $ After 10 years, I now downloaded McCaffee's product after calling their support....they answered quickly, and for free, and were very helpful.
Norton $ neg $ No problems now, just a sickly disappointment in the way Norton has abandoned thier customers.
Norton $ neg $ I see many other reviews that say the same....stay away from Norton, they don't deserve you, or anyone!
firewall $ pos $ It's a highly rated, KICK ASS firewall program that's bundled with the venerable Norton AntiVirus, plus extras (like Norton AntiSpam & Norton Parental Control) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access.
version 2004 $ neg $ I've alway liked Symantec products, except for this version 2004.
installing $ neg $ If you are already using a previous version of nortron security and unistalled it to install the new version, you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system!
product $ pos $ Luckly,with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing! it is indeed worth nothing.
install $ neg $ To install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called Symantec or Nortron,... also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted.
installation $ neg $ If you have no previous version of  nortron security on your system, or Nortron Antivirus, the installation will go fine, otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up!the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation, even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly.
support $ neg $ What dissapointes me the most that a software like that  is not cheap gets zero support form symantec, if you want support, they'll charge you a Fee!
zone alarm $ pos $ I've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of sygate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great!.
symantec $ neg $ I am giving a zero star to symantec for this version!
help $ pos $ The only free help you get is in renewing your subscription!
Firewall $ neg $ The only way my pc internet works is if I open the Firewall Program configuration and manually refresh it.
Symantec $ neg $ Symantec should give us all a refund and apology!
product $ neg $ I will NEVER buy their product again at this rate, and neither should you.
product $ pos $ The product has worked perfectly for me on my XP.
antivirus $ pos $ No more banner ads, pop-ups, and the reliable antivirus.
antivirus $ pos $ I work on word, explorer, netscape, acrobat reader, photoshop at same time (meaning using a lot of memory), but still dont see a problem with computer (getting slow or crashing).
product $ pos $ This product is way cooler than anything Ive used before (PcCillins and McCafees and Norton Antivirus alone).
product $ pos $ 5 stars all the way!
Product  $ pos $ All in all it hasn't been a bad product.
Symantec $ neg $ However, Symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release.
firewall $ neg $ While it has a rather effective firewall, and comes with Norton Antivirus (which I'm actually rather fond of), the Security Suite has significantly slowed down my system.
boot $ neg $ I'm currently using a Sony Vaio S-150 (which I bought at the end of this past August), and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact, I've taken to just hibernating, rather than shutting down completely.
antivirus $ neg $ The Antivirus is good, but "Internet Security" just isn't worth it.
performance $ pos $ I've owned many Norton products in my time, and for the most part, I've been pleased with their performance.
NIS 2004 $ pos $ This is also the case with NIS 2004.
upgrade $ pos $ I upgraded from NIS 2003, and the change in performance has not been noticeable.
upgrade $ pos $ On the contrary, I'm quite pleased with my upgrade.
performance $ pos $ It works better and has more useful features than NIS 2003.
program $ pos $ The program is fully featured, with much of what you'd want from a security program --
installation $ neg $ The installation, set-up, and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well.
symantec $ neg $ HOWEVER, I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT AND WITH SYMANTEC.
performance $ neg $ It feels like I'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service, even though I'm running a Dell 2GHz Pentium 4 with 256MB memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year.
performance $ neg $ I tried disabling the various components provided with this product, paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service... and saw no improvement.
symantec/Norton site $ neg $ There is absolutely nothing useful at the Symantec/Norton site.
PRODUCT $ neg $ However, I suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.
Uninstall $ pos $ PIII 1Ghz 512MB RDRAM Windows XP Pro 80GB HD  I was able to Uninstall NIS 2003 and Install NIS 2004 with no trouble.
install $ pos $ I installed, activated and registered NIS 2004 without issue.
Anti-Spam $ neg $ So far, the Anti-Spam feature seems to be very good.
program $ neg $ This program would not let me send Outlook Email or listen to Audible sample books online.
product $ neg $ Buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks.
processor $ neg $ I had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed (mainly the SLOOOOOOOOOW processor), and then I couldn't get the damn thing off my computer completely!
install $ neg $ It locked during install and I had to reformat the drive and start from scratch (GRRRRRR!)
Computer Associates EZ $ pos $ I downloaded a trial version of Computer Associates EZ Firewall and Antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again.
Norton $ neg $ And I can't warn you enough to STAY AWAY FROM NORTON!!
installation $ pos $ I did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here.
speed $ neg $ It was immediately noticeable that NIS slows down my computer (Pent4, 256 RAM).
size $ neg $ I think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program.
scan $ neg $ Is it necessary to scan my MS Money database when I close the program?
firewall $ neg $ I have a modern PC with lots of speed and memory, but this firewall just brought it to a halt.
slow $ neg $ Start up, log off, log on...everything became very slow.
home network $ neg $ Configuring it for a home network was almost impossible.
network $ neg $ Multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you'd expect.
alerts $ neg $ While I was trying to play Half Life 2 it started popping up with "alerts" every twenty seconds (literally), warning me my antivirus protection was off.
alerts $ neg $ But it wouldn't let me turn the AV protection back on and it wouldn't stop with the alerts.
uninstall $ neg $ I had tried to uninstall Norton Internet Security a few weeks ago, and it wouldn't let me do that either.
Uninstall $ neg $ I tried it again this morning and it said I didn't have the required "permissions" and lacked proper administrator status.
Symantec customer service $ neg $ Of course, if you try to reach Symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident.
uninstallation $ neg $ This time, it started the uninstallation process, then I left for work. I think it will work. I hope it will work.
Symantec $ neg $ I simply hate Symantec. I swear, if I could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare, bleeding hands, I would have.
products $ pos $ Their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions.
phone $ pos $ I've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and I truely love it.
battery life $ neg $ The only disappointment so far has been battery life.
battery life $ neg $ Mine generally requires a charege every 48 hours or so and I don't really talk on it that much.
phone $ pos $ It has it all.
phone $ pos $ This is the first phone I know of that has the large bright screen, infrared, bluetooth, USB connector and a speakerphone.
phone $ pos $ If you are looking for an upgrade, this is definitely the phone for you.

battery life $ pos $ Goes ~3 days after a charge.
phone $ neg $ I purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of Nokia phones available.
priced $ neg $ I thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time.
phone $ pos $ I must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held.
use $ pos $ It has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight.
keypad $ pos $ 1.The Phone has the best keypad any Nokia phone has to offer.
keypad $ pos $ Believe me when I say this I have used and fingered all Nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
look $ pos $ I must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
interface $ pos $ 3. The Nokia 6600 has a brilliant Java interface.
MMC card $ pos $ The Phone offers a 32 Mb MMC card and I think that is certainly the most exciting feature.
Capacity $ pos $ Capacity is not a problem here.
Build $ pos $ 4. The Build is just right.
sturdy $ pos $ The phone is sturdy.
build $ pos $ I've dropped it atleast a dozen times to my recolletion and it still works as good as ever.
phone $ pos $ Its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it.

handsfree $ pos $ The handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving.
processor $ neg $ Anyhow some demerits of this phone, The phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most Nokia variants.
battery life $ neg $ The battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use.
Video recording $ neg $ Video recording is limited at just 9 seconds.
upgrade $ neg $ You can upgrade but then there's a certain level of trouble involved.
phone $ pos $ This makes for a great phone.
phone $ neg $ I've had Nokia's for years, and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone.
phone $ neg $ On the plus side it's packed with features, including BlueTooth that works fine - it's really a tiny computer that is also a phone... and that's the negative.
screen $ neg $ As a computer, or PDA its weak since the screen, while large by phone standards, is still tiny to really do anything on.
dial $ neg $ When you dial a number, you'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct.
keys $ neg $ You'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once.
screen $ neg $ I hope you have a magnifying glass, because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny.
screen $ neg $ It's as though Nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use.
phone $ neg $ I've have many Nokia's and while this is the best for features, it's the worst as a phone.
feels $ neg $ This phone is flashy and feels good in the hand, but it could not hold a connection to any of my bluetooth devices (headset, handheld, or desktop computer).
phone $ neg $ My old Siemens s56, on the other hand, worked beautifully with all of the above.
camera $ neg $ who in the hell needs a frigging *VGA* camera on their CELLPHONE???
phone $ pos $ since then, i have not found one major problem with it.
camera $ pos $ i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a PDA.
bulky $ neg $ Sure, it is a relatively bulky, but it is really packed with many great features.
bluetooth $ pos $ I own this phone for about 6 months now, I have used the following features: bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with Outlook, transfer files (movies, songs), I have many movies on it now with a 512MB memory card that it takes.
Handsfree $ pos $ Handsfree future is good, but not too exciting.
Camera $ neg $ Camera is nice, and video recording for some reason is only limited to 9 seconds.
slow $ neg $ Only thing I don't like about it is slow in changing apps, boot up, and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth.
looking $ pos $ This one has a good looking.
look $ pos $ It's oval and... nice.
shape $ pos $ I like it's shape and it's keypad and joystick.
use $ pos $ It's easy to use. Not too small, and not too big.
screen $ pos $ The screen is quite big (between all handphone), but the just about 65000 color.
camera $ neg $ And, other else,  the camera is still VGA.
slow $ neg $ I must say, this one is quite slow to open an application.
phone $ neg $ Sometimes, it needs few minutes to open an application.
phone $ pos $ Few month ago, it's very popular among my community.
phone $ pos $ It's good.
phone $ neg $ But not good enough for me.
color $ pos $ :! OK, score 7.0 Oh yes, the newest color of this phone is quite cool.
Nokia $ neg $ I have overall been disappointed with Nokia in the past, finding that Samsung and Motorola tended to have better quality phones.
6600 $ pos $ While this phone obviously doesn't have the same quality construction as Motorola does, the Nokia 6600 is one of the better phones I've used.
versatility $ pos $ What makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has.
audio quality $ pos $ 1) Great audio quality overall.
audio quality $ pos $ Handset quality is great, as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality.
camera $ pos $ A decent camera phone for taking quick pictures, movies, and having general all around fun with.
joystick $ pos $ 3) The joystick design they are using on the new Nokias gives you a great degree of control.
joystick $ neg $ The only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming.
ring tone $ pos $ 4) One nice thing about Nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices.
Nokia $ pos $ If you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday, Nokia beats everyone else.
Bluetooth $ pos $ 5) Bluetooth wireless technology, so that I can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables.
wide $ pos $ 6) The phone is really wide, which seems to be a turnoff for many people, but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic.
small $ pos $ I feel much less likely to drop this phone than others, which are actually starting to get too small.
construction $ neg $ My biggest concern is that I have found Nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices, but they also don't last as long.
construction $ pos $ I can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than Motorolas do, but as long as I'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine.
phone $ pos $ Other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won't disappoint any already established Nokia phone fans.
interface $ neg $ OPERATION: It's like BMW's I-Drive - It does it's job, but has the most unintuitive, overly-layered interface.
operation $ neg $ The phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card... and turning the phone back on takes a little while.
instruction booklet $ neg $ Even the instruction booklet is out of order.
applications $ pos $ APPLICATIONS: It has lots of applications and they work very well... when you eventually find where they are and they finally open.
applications $ neg $ No matter how accustomed to the phone you become, too much time is required to get to, open and close applications.
6600 $ pos $ The 6600 has more ameneties than most - World phone, Camera (VGA/zoom/night mode/timer), Video (w/ audio & zoom), Speaker (good sound), Bluetooth, infrared, Modem for computers, electronic wallet, Internet access, Calendar, calculator, converter and more.
phone $ neg $ The phone does not have an Mp3-player, FM radio, 200k+ color screen, megapixel camera, quad band, PDA, photo editor.
DEPENDABILITY $ pos $ DEPENDABILITY: I've seen no glitches.
phone $ pos $ I've had no problems w/ this phone.
keys $ neg $ STYLING/ERGONOMICS: The keys are small, which generally doesn't bother me if they are spaced because I can employ a little 'Braille,' but the keys run into each other, so careful attn. must be paid when dialing.
stylized $ neg $ It's not as stylized as a Sony or Samsung.
big $ pos $ Although it has chubby hips, the device isn't really so big.
screen $ pos $ Solid, squeak-free, large screen.
MEMORY $ pos $ MEMORY/STORAGE - Seemingly boundless.
memory $ pos $ First of all, the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos, sound clips, photos, texts, etc.
transmission $ pos $ Secondly, all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of USB wires.
6600 $ pos $ The 6600 (T-Mobile) is the true 'world phone' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe, including New Zealand and Australia (900) whereas the  6620 (available from Cingular) replaces it w/ 800mhz (some refer to as 850).
coverage $ pos $ The latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of The States but still operates in many countries, excluding New Zealand and Australia.
6600 $ neg $ The 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of The States and not as well in more remote areas.
6600 $ pos $ As the 6600 uses 900mhz, it operates in more countries than the 6620.
battery life $ pos $ The battery life is less than stellar, but it charges w/ the quickness.
operating system $ pos $ Remember, this phone uses an operating system - Symbian... and it's feature-rich w/ 65k colors.
video $ pos $ It films 10 second video, for crying out loud.
battery life $ neg $ The battery life can't be very long; let's not be greedy.
game $ neg $ Don't use them, so I delete them for addtl space.
downloads $ pos $ There are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be texted to you at no cost.
phone $ pos $ A Sony Ericcson may be the phone for you... but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price.
phone $ pos $ Despite a critical start, this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do (which is pretty lofty)... does more than most... does it well... is dependable.
phone $ neg $ When you consider expandability (downloads via computer), the numerous features, two transmission programs and multiple storage devices, dependability - this is a phone that isn't easy to out-grow.
BLUETOOTH $ neg $ BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.
Bluetooth $ neg $ Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.
PHONE $ neg $ Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!
nokia $ neg $ This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.
Nokia $ neg $ In short - Nokia themselves don't know that this phone doesn't work with the Palm, and if you don't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.
Nokia $ neg $ Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.
photos $ neg $ The photos in the address book are terribly scaled too; they look as though they were built out of legos.
phone $ pos $ This phone is one of the best I've ever used.
phone $ pos $ It has everything I needed: bluetooth, infrared, support for MMC, camera, and a good operating system with lots of supporting software.
phone $ pos $ I would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone.
interface $ neg $ It's important that people know the following:  First, the interface is slow.
interface $ neg $ You hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of SECONDS to bring up the menu.
lag $ neg $ Secondly, in addition to the lag each time you give a command, it's just not that easily useable on the go.
number buttons $ neg $ The number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area, the fonts are small, the interface is too convoluted and frustrating, it's not that customisable as well.
look $ pos $ The plusses are the features, look, good signal and battery life, memory size and robustness.
camera $ pos $ The camera and video functionality is decent, I can't see myself wasting my time with it, but some people will.
phone $ pos $ this is a great phone i have this phone since Feb 04 and i never have any problem at all.
features $ pos $ very cool features... great camera with zoom...cool quality pictures... great ringtones... bluetooth feature is great....
phone $ neg $ This phone is not suitable for fast people, maybe only for old people.
slow $ neg $ The menu pops up after 3 seconds The picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory.
time $ neg $ The navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy.
big $ neg $ At first glance, I thought this phone was a little too big for me, maybe a little too complicated.
phone $ pos $ This thing does everything but washes your dishes.
modem $ pos $ I can use it as a modem for my computer, connect with clients and friends, the possibilities are endless.
ringtones $ pos $ The ringtones are beautiful, the screen is super high quality.
carrier $ neg $ I can NOT find a carrier for this phone I like, end up just tossing it in my purse.
phone $ pos $ I do not need to repeat what's great about this phone.

feature $ neg $ My old Sony Ericsson T610 has this feature.
hear $ neg $ In noisy environment, it's hard to hear from the earpiece.
volume $ neg $ Speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifaces the battery life.
phone $ neg $ Unfortunately , I sold it exactly a month later .
volume $ neg $ 1-A cell phone is to make CALLS , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
bulky $ neg $ 2- It is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
SLOW $ neg $ 3- It is SLOW , if you keep the original configuration and progs (why'd u buy it then ?!) it'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen Nokias .
phone $ neg $ 4- My idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone excells at nothing , less  than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the "other than phone" functionalities , you'll be disappointed .... if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine .... but don't expect to get much done .
features $ neg $ Basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don't and won't need (if you do get yourself a PDA or pocket PC) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
phone $ neg $ I'm an advocate of Nokia , but this phone and the following models (7610) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
phones $ neg $ I'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other Nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies (such a samsung and motorrola) it might be good .... but if you're getting a Nokia , don't get this one .
phone $ pos $ I never had a single problem.
menu $ pos $ It is Nokia and thus easy to acces the menu options.
video $ pos $ High quality video and pictures rock!
band $ pos $ 3 band and you can just change the SIM card in it to be able to use it in Europe with another service provider.
phone $ pos $ Bottom line great phone for the time being.
color TFT display $ pos $ I use a Nokia 6600, it has a great color TFT display and camera equipped with zoom, which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a RealOne player for playback and streaming of 3GPP-compatible and RealMedia video clips.
Multimedia functions $ pos $ Multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide MMS messages and a Gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone.
6600 $ pos $ The Nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smartphone line.
keypad $ pos $ The phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display, long rundown time and a good software suite.
MMC slot $ neg $ Among its weak points is the MMC slot location and a bit vague design.
6600 $ pos $ In short, the Nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution.
multimedia $ pos $ I'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does, but for me the best thing is that I can easily check my email, movie times, news, or any website with this phone.
picture $ pos $ You can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call.
ringtone $ pos $ Give each friend a different ringtone.
rings $ pos $ Get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings.

phone $ pos $ Everything, so far, has worked flawlessly.
phone $ pos $ All at the same time, and all without a hitch.

6600 $ pos $ I actually purchased two phones recently (this one at the new Blackberry phone), and this one is far superior (IMHO).
features $ pos $ I love the features, the interface, the size (the screen is a delight), the camera (though I admit I'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me), the internet connectivity, the quality, etc.
phone $ pos $ If I had to do it over, I wouldn't buy anything else.
signal $ pos $ UPSIDE: This one, like most Nokias, receives a consistently strong signal (I've tried some Samsung and Sony Ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front).
Bluetooth $ pos $ I love the Bluetooth; easy to use with a wireless Jabra headset.
Photos $ pos $ Photos are pretty darned good!
speed $ neg $ DOWNSIDE: It takes a long time to start up.
speed $ neg $ My last simpler Nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use.
movies $ neg $ The "movies" last about 5 seconds.
movies $ neg $ I mean, they're short!
feature $ neg $ I find this feature on this phone useless, but, since I don't really need this function anyway, I don't really use it.
navigatee $ neg $ Also, when I dial an "800" number like an airline, it will not allow me to use number keys to navigatee the prerecorded menu.
screen $ neg $ Finally, after about a week's use, the screen started to freeze on me.
calls $ neg $ It would not hang up on calls.
screen $ neg $ Once it froze so bad I couldn't even use the power button to turn it off, and had to open and take out the battery.
phone $ pos $ Probably a great phone overall, and perhaps mine just has bugs.
user-interfaces $ neg $ With one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around, seamless bluetooth sync with Microsoft Outlook, support for thousands of applications for the Symbian platform which this phone runs on (I own the IR Remote, ICQ and a few others), the Nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from T-Mobile that can claim such a distinction.
phone $ pos $ Ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone I have owned.
camera $ neg $ The only con I can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera.
phone $ pos $ This may be a really cool phone, but it's not worth it with T-Mobile.

T-Mobile $ neg $ I really regret signing up with T-Mobile, but I'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract.
phone $ pos $ This phone is fantastic.
reception $ pos $ Great reception, visibility and interface (may be complicated by others).
rebate $ neg $ Just don't get drawn into T-Mobile's catchy rebate.
rebate $ neg $ T-Mobile wasn't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate.
phone $ pos $ I highly recommend this phone.
Sony ericsson T610 $ pos $ I had a Sony ericsson T610 before this and the T610 is far inferior.
back cover $ neg $ I find it difficult to remove back cover so is you plan to have a spare battery and replace it I suggest you don't ,besides it has a long battery life.
battery life $ pos $ Im able to keep my phone on for about a week (mostly stand by) to three days (regular use)
phone $ pos $ but this by far is the best phone out there right now!
large $ neg $ yes it is a bit large, but the realestate on the screen will spoil you!
screens $ pos $ i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens!!!
OS $ neg $ the OS is abit confusing at 1st, but within a few days you will pass this learning curve!
pics $ pos $ the pics can be touched up in photoshop, and be printed at 4x6 and they look great!
bluetooth $ pos $ i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my Apple powerbook!
bluetooth $ pos $ The speed is the same as dail up, where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up.
phone $ pos $ The phone itself is pretty nice.
Camera quality $ pos $ Camera quality isn't bad for the low resolution.
Menu $ neg $ Menu is a bit slow, but overall, phone is very functional.
features $ pos $ This phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard.
Motorola T720i $ neg $ I was using a Motorola T720i with Verizon and I had alot of dropped calls and I had troubles syncing data.
Bluetooth $ pos $ I was looking for a phone which synced with Mac OSX using Bluetooth, had decent battery life, could check email, had good reception, nice screen size and was durable (I break often break small gadgets)
interface $ pos $ The interface is simple to use.
menus $ neg $ I saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and I feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time.
menu $ pos $ I have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds, no big deal.
menus $ pos $ I did notice if you turn the phone on and off the OS takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker.
camera $ pos $ The camera is adequate and if I want high-res photos I'll use my digital camera instead.
T-Mobile service $ neg $ On the T-Mobile service I was able to take pics as we drove across I-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a T-Mobile tzone (usually a major city).
T-Mobile service $ neg $ Outside of the T-Mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto AT&T Wireless and various other services where the T-Mobile service was unavailable.
reception $ pos $ As I drove across the country I lost reception only in eastern Kentucky's mountains.
6600 $ pos $ Along the way we compared it to my wife's T720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life, connectivity bars and features.
iSync $ pos $ For those Mac OSX users out there, iSync works fairly well.
Bluetooth $ neg $ On occasion I'm not able to connect to the phone with iSync via Bluetooth but I found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem.

battery $ pos $ With Bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long.

bluetooth $ pos $ I've connected the phone with two laptops and a iPaq 4155.
bluetooth $ pos $ Very simple and painless.
phone $ pos $ This is the first cell phone I've owned, and overall, I am quite pleased with it.
phone $ pos $ Among my requirments for a phone were: good screen, decent camera, bluetooth, and GPRS support.
6600 $ pos $ The 6600 was the best phone I could find with these options that I could get with t-mobile.
internet $ pos $ One primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that I could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux, where softmodem drivers are hard to find, and don't work very well.
GPRS $ pos $ If you are using Linux, and you want to use GPRS to connect to the net, I suggest this phone along with a Belkin USB Bluetooth adapter.
camera $ pos $ I have really enjoyed the camera on this phone.
images $ neg $ Although the images are not the best in the world, its very handy to have a camera everywhere you go.
feature $ pos $ And the phone has a very cool feature wich allows you to send images via a normal POP3/SMTP e-mail account.
e-mail $ neg $ I will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward, although you do need an external SMTP server to use.
ringtone $ pos $ The phone can use any MIDI audio file as a ringtone.
ringtone $ pos $ Which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in MIDI format for free on the net.
bluetooth $ pos $ You can use the OBEX File Transfer service with bluetooth from linux (KDE-bluetooth provieds a nice intergration into Konqueror for this) for sending files to the phone.
ringtones $ pos $ The fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool.
OS $ neg $ I will say that the OS that the phone runs does have a few issues.
applications $ neg $ Sometimes, various applications crash.
bluetooth $ neg $ Especially the bluetooth server... Meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again.
bluetooth $ neg $ This is somewhat annoying, but from working with computers (espcially windows -- ugh...)
Freespeak $ pos $ I really dislike holding a phone to my ear, and I've found the Freespeak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone.
voice-dialing system $ neg $ The only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky.
voice-dialing system $ neg $ It takes a while to learn how to use it right, and at this point I am able to make about 70% of my calls using it.
voice-dialing system $ neg $ However, it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn't work at all in the car, for example.
size $ neg $ Some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone, and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name "the bar of soap" which, it really is.
size $ pos $ But if you use all bluetooth accessories, as I do, its really not an issue.
phone $ pos $ All in all, this is a great phone.
price $ pos $ Especially for the price amazon gives it at (I was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications).

size $ pos $ I like the size and shape.

battery life $ neg $ Also the battery life isn't great but it's sufficient for my needs.
calls $ pos $ It also works just fine for international calls.

T-Mobile $ neg $ I've had nothing but good luck with T-Mobile.
customer service agents $ pos $ Their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific.
calls $ pos $ I never get dropped calls.
T-Mobile $ neg $ It seems to be a much more user friendly company than Verizon and a thousand percent better than the horrible Quest Wireless.
T-Mobile $ neg $ I recommend T-Mobile and the Nokia 6600 without reservation.
6600 $ neg $ The Nokia 6600 is really just a glorified 3650: you know the 3650, those bulbous, formless, big phones a few unfortunate ATT customers are carrying around.
OS $ pos $ The Nokia 660 runs the Symbian OS, which works pretty well for most standard phone fare, most of the stuff is not that intuitive, but if you actually learn how to use it all, there's plenty of neat tie-ins.
phone $ pos $ I've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use.
bluetooth $ pos $ I can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images, calender events, contacts and anything else.
ringers $ pos $ Another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load .wav sounds as ringers.
ringtones $ pos $ This way I never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones, I can get whatever I want.
slow $ neg $ The only downside I have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react, meaning when I push the contacts button, it takes a while to load, this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone.
OS $ pos $ Other than that, the simbian series 60 OS is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you're willing to hunt for it.
Hand set $ neg $ Hand set is good, but be aware of this T-MOBILE rebate.
rebate $ neg $ These people takes lest effort to process rebate forms.
rebate $ neg $ For last one month my Rebate status showing me that my rebate is apporved and check is delivered but still I am waiting for Check.
customer care $ neg $ There is no way you can talk with customer care about this.
rebates $ neg $ Dont rely on T-Mobile rebates.

size $ neg $ 3) Phone is kinda heavy, but small in size.
Buttons $ neg $ 4) Buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging.
Buttons $ neg $ There will be much erasing of text as, one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters.
video recorder $ neg $ 5) Video recorder is of no use and one cannot record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the "Free picture and video messaging" offered by service provider.
Phone $ pos $ The bottom line is "Phone is cool one - only for the moment, as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features, but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones".

MMC memory $ pos $ It uses the extendable MMC memory, it is perfect for storing videos, pictures and mp3s.

phone $ pos $ I am just in love with this phone, especially after using a more primitve phone about 3 years.
instruction $ neg $ Unfortunately, Creative offered scant few pages of instruction, which meant that I was on own from the outset. 
touch-pad $ neg $ After attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system, I could not get the unit to download my wma files. 
EXPLAIN $ neg $ SO, YOU MIGHT INQUIRE, WHY DON'T THEY MAKE IT A FIRST PRIORITY TO CAREFULLY, SIMPLY EXPLAIN HOW DOWNLOAD MUSIC FROM YOUR MUSIC LIBRARY TO THEIR DEVICE??? This seems academic to me.
navigating $ neg $ Most of us just want to plug and play, not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options...like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing.
sound $ pos $ All of this said [as it's on it's way back to Amazon], the one song it did include provided far better sound than the IPOD. 
bass $ pos $ The base was deeper and the highs were crisper. 
touch-pad $ neg $ Unfortunately, the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it. 
machine $ pos $ what a kick butt Mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source, instead of paying for them two or three times, then get the Creative Zen IPOD killer, kiss my ass Itunes!
Zen Micro $ neg $ This one is particularly bothersome: Allegedly one can use the Zen Micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another.
store $ neg $ Although you can store any type of file on the Zen Micro to download onto a different computer, you need to INSTALL (on the computer you are moving the data to) Zen Micro software and drivers to do it!!! 
software $ neg $ Who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?  
sound $ pos $ The sound is great, the portability, etc... all the "stuff" you expect from a good MP-3 player, this Zen Micro has it. 
Button sensitivity $ neg $ ) Button sensitivity: Even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting, the buttons are far two sensitive, really takes some getting use to, and even then, it is still too sensitive. 
FEATURE $ neg $ ) WORST FEATURE POSSIBLE, THIS ALONE MAKES IT RATE ONE STAR: What's up with no recharge cord? 
cost $ neg $ You have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost. 
charged $ neg $ I took my Zen Micro with me over the weekend, and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason: to keep the Zen Micro charged. 
product $ neg $ I have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone. 
prices $ neg $ ) Creative, Inc. the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box, then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on EVERY single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices. 
case $ neg $ The box included a little polyester, pull-string BAG, (yes, you read right a BAG, something a boy would carry ten marbles in) and tries to pass it off as the case. 
case $ neg $ If you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you Zen Micro, expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time. . 
battery $ pos $ ) One outstanding positive feature is the battery. It holds a charge for a long time, longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup. 
rechargeable battery $ pos $ Creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature. .
FM receiver $ pos $ The Zen Micro FM receiver is ok, not great. 
FM receiver $ neg $ IRiver has a better FM receiver built in, but the drawback to IRiver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed. 
constructed $ pos $ ) The Zen Micro appears sturdy and well constructed, hefty, if you will, far better than many of its competitors. . 
charges $ neg $ As I wrote, this COULD have been a great product, but expect hidden charges (read gross profiteering and price gouging) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage.     
Zen Micro $ pos $ Well, I have an Ipod mini - and I really like it, but all in all, I like the Zen Micro more.
size $ pos $ Smaller size, 1 gb of more space, radio, voice recording, removable battery, cooler look, all in one.  
touchpad $ neg $ The touchpad is annoying sometimes (give me the click-wheel and pressable buttons any day), but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying.
small $ pos $ I love how small the thing is, and the blue glow - I've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all.  
Media Source $ pos $ Creative Media Source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it, and the file transfers are fast.  
Sound $ pos $ Sound quality is great, fm tuner is fine, as is the recorder.  
player $ pos $ This is the mp3 player with everything I need.  As long as it lasts me a good three years, I'm satisfied.        
player $ pos $ Also If you want a device that does soo much more than the Ipod mini but is at the same price, this is the player for you. 
Headphones $ neg $ and supply those stupid white Headphones. 
small $ pos $ Upon opening the box I was confronted with this small cute little MP3 player. 
installation $ pos $ The software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the Creative software, Windows Media Player 10, or simply Windows Explorer to move music back and forth between your Zen Touch. 
touch pad $ neg $ The touch pad does take a little getting used to. 
cable $ pos $ The package also comes with a USB cable, an AC adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your Zen Touch in.  
Zen Touch $ pos $ Overall I'm incredibly impressed with my new Zen Touch. 
looks $ pos $ It's cute as anything and the glowing blue LED looks super cool around the edges. 
player $ pos $ For the price I think this is a remarkably fun MP3 player.
player $ pos $ I've had this player for more than 4 months and I'm very happy with it. 
Speakers $ pos $ 1 Speakers at home, I rarely use it with the earbuds, though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players.  
Look $ pos $ The Look & Feel: I have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambience. 
tiny $ neg $ The player itself is tiny , it gets a bit bulky when you put it in the hardcase, which you need to do if you don't want to get scrathes on the back(its a nice looking back too ). 
feels $ pos $ It feels tiny in the hand without it. 
stand $ pos $ The stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk. 
looks $ pos $ The blue backlit LCD looks really neat and is easy to read. 
touch controls $ neg $ The touch controls took a little getting used to but now I wouldn't change it for the scroll wheel. 
touch buttons $ pos $ The touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon't slip which was very thoughtful.   
Build $ pos $ Reliability & Build  I dropped the player once from about 4 ft, and it fell hard, but kept on playing. 
hardcase $ pos $ The hardcase they give with it must work well.  
solid $ pos $ It feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon.  
sound $ pos $ Sound  I'm no audiophile but I was amazed by the clarity the player had, it was much better than the sound card on my Computer and louder too. 
sound $ pos $ I have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright.  
sound $ pos $ Best of all the WMAs(I have a lot of them) sound great.  
features $ pos $ Utility Its got a huge list of features including an FM Recorder a Calender and contacts list. 
recorded $ pos $ The songs recorded with FM are as good as the original signal. 
software $ neg $ Software The software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well. 
playlists $ pos $ Creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean.  
battery life $ neg $ There are 2 things that need fixing  First is the battery life. It will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons. 
USB $ neg $ Second might be a problem I might have with my PC but not too sure, when the player is connected on the USB and I start playing on it and also using the windows explorer, it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronise with the PC during play, which is a bit irritating.     
creative zen $ pos $ I think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good.  
headphone jack $ neg $ HOWEVER after just one month my headphone jack was BROKEN as a result of normal, every-day use.  
support $ pos $ The good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges, i had a new zen.  
organization $ neg $ i dont especially like how music files are unstructured; basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization, like you might have in windows explorer folders and subfolders.  
sound $ pos $ the sound is quite good, in terms of volume.  
headphones $ neg $ the headphones are not very comfortable, but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have.  
installation $ pos $ i didnt have any installation problems; and the touch pad is fine, even if it is sort of inaccurate.  
cheaper $ pos $ i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes (no music i want, but thats just me) and the creative product was cheaper; and i needed to be able to use WMA files.  
price $ pos $ all-in-all, its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use.       
software $ neg $ The Creative MediaSource software that comes with the Zen Micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in iTunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder. 
Player $ neg $ NAGATIVES of the Player itself:  You need to do a little work before having full enjoyement of this player.  
sensitivy $ neg $ Even on the LOW sensitivy level, a slight touch can skip or pause the track.  
player $ neg $ This fixes some glitches such as the player freezing.    
battery $ pos $ The battery is removable. 
FM radio $ pos $  FM radio built in (Howard Stern).  
microphone $ pos $ Record memos using the built in microphone.  
looks $ pos $ The player looks SO much better when you're actually holding it. 
back $ pos $ The back of the player is nice too, with water ripples inside the clear white coating.  
storage $ pos $ You can use it as a storage Hard Drive.    
iTunes $ pos $ I have no problem using iTunes with the Zen Micro (in a makeshift sorta way).   
made $ neg $ First thing I noticed was that the creative wasn't well made. 
player $ neg $ One drop from a pocket or desktop, and it'd be a goner.  
sound $ neg $  Problems with the sound quality were evident right away, but even I couldn't imagine they'd be that bad. 
eq $ neg $ The eq is awful, and even at top volumes, the bass is flat sounding. 
volume  $ neg $ Cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality. 
headphone jack $ neg $ The headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use, and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony's I'd been having. 
sound $ neg $ If you've been listening to cd's in your car for awhile, dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to. 
car adapter $ pos $ However, if there was one thing I liked about the creative, it would be the car adapter. 
storage $ neg $ Even after all the nightmare sound problems, I'd still half-way like this product if it kept it's promise; the ability to store 1500 songs. 
storage $ neg $ I got about 700 loaded up before it told me I was full, and at that point, I was ready to toss it out the window.   
creative $ neg $ My friend has an ipod, and although the sound quality probably won't meet most audiophile standards, the product itself is better than anything creative has made.
compatibility with windows media player $ pos $ While they all seem to have their own positives and negatives, I picked the Zen Micro over the Ipod mini, because I am not an Apple person, never has been - I wanted something that is fully compatible with Windows Media Player. 
format $ pos $ Also, the WMA compression format is superior to MP3, especially at lower bit rates, so I needed a player that could handle WMA and integrate well with my Windows XP computers.  
accessories $ pos $ I was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories (desk stand/hard case, belt clip, wall charger, etc). 
Zen Micro $ pos $ And so far, I have been very, very happy with my Zen Micro. 
working $ pos $ It's being used daily and I have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers (headphone jack, player locking up, etc). 
features $ pos $ The Micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface. 
feel $ pos $ What I like the most:  - Small and solid feel. 
size $ pos $ The Zen Micro is smaller than it looks in pictures, and feels very solid. 
backlight $ pos $ The blue backlight is pretty cool. 
screen $ pos $ The screen is clear and readable, and the touch pad works very well, it took me less than a day to get the hang of it, and now I like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control.  
sound $ pos $ - Great sound! I was very impressed, I encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great, especially with the better headphones. 
transfer $ pos $ The first thing I did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for WMP10, it syncs flawlessly with Media Player and transfers are fast.  
battery $ pos $ - Replaceable battery. 
interface $ pos $ With the right firmware, drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive.  
player $ pos $ I have not yet used all the features, like the calendar, etc, but as a music player this little thing rocks.  
battery life $ neg $ The only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life I can probably get 6-8 hours at most. 
battery life $ neg $ Even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the Zen Micro in any way. 
warranty price $ pos $ If you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty, this is the player to get! Highly recommended.     
price $ pos $ The Micro seeemed like an iPod for less. 
sound $ pos $ Pros: - Excellent sound, even with the headphones that come out of the box, but it absolutely rocked with my Bose Quietcomfort 2 set. 
look $ pos $ - Looks sleek, compact, has a radio.  
accessories $ neg $ Limitations: - Not a lot of original accessories like the iPod. 
battery life $ neg $ - The battery life leaves a lot to be desired. 
firmware $ neg $ I downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem, but it hasn't worked. 
outlook sync $ neg $ - The outlook synch only works for non recurring appointments, which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people. - 
touchpad $ neg $ I occassionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly (yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode). 
audible.com book compatibility $ neg $ - Not compatible with Audible.com books.  
Zen Micro $ neg $ Overall, it does its basic function very well, but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the Zen Micro does not rise to the occassion.     
player $ pos $ Don't worry this player rocks.  
appeal $ pos $ It was also the most appealing.   
packing $ pos $ For the Zen Creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out, well presented and easy to open and put back together.  
casing $ pos $ It has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside.  
case $ pos $ A distinct IPod relation is evident with white colored cables, power plug and the very nice Zen case with a white rubber inside covering.  
design $ pos $ I do give create to Creative for their attractive design.    
functionality $ pos $ Creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices. 
player $ pos $ Creative was defiantly giving the IPod a run for their money with this device.  
player $ pos $ It makes the Nomad I purchase feel and look like junk.  
quality $ pos $ Everything shines of quality.  
player $ pos $ I was more excited about this player upon opening than I was about the Nomad.  
accessories $ pos $ I am now staring at an array of stuff including Zen Micro player, stereo earbud headphones, a rechargeable lithium-ion battery, an AC/DC power adapter, a USB 2.0 cable, a belt-clip, a stand, a stylish cloth pouch, an installation CD, a quick-start guide, and Creative MediaSource software.  
interface $ pos $ The interface works great.  
touchpad $ pos $ I enjoy getting use to the touch pad. 
navigation $ pos $ In minutes I was easily navigating through the menus.  
sound $ pos $ What impressed me most was the sound.  
sound $ pos $ At 128 the songs sound very good.  
audio quality $ pos $ The Zen lives up to the audio quality I love and expect.  
headphones $ pos $ The Earbuds are great headphones as good as my AGK Studio 240, well not as good but darn close.  
Zen $ pos $ The Zen was an impressive purchase and I would highly recommend it to anyone using Napster.  
player $ pos $ I absolutely love it. 
size $ pos $ It's so small. 
look $ pos $ It looks sleek and modern. 
storage $ pos $ It holds plenty of songs. 
sound $ pos $ The sound is amazing. 
menu $ pos $ The menu is easy to use and understand. 
touchpad controls $ pos $ I love the touchpade controls. 
touchpad controls $ pos $ They're easy to use. 
radio $ pos $ The radio and voice recording are nice. 
headphones $ pos $ The earbud headphones are really nice. 
batterylife $ pos $ The battery has a long life. 
battery replacement $ pos $ It's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though I haven't had to do it yet of course. 
file transfer/rip software $ pos $ The file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use. 
file transfer $ pos $ It's faster than WMP. 
player $ pos $ So far I have no complaints with this player. 
player $ pos $ If anyone is thinkning of getting an ipod mini, forget it and go with this player. 
price $ pos $ It's cheaper, holds more songs and is smaller.      
storage $ pos $ I have stored 40 audio CDs and i still have close to 2.8 GB free.   
software $ pos $ User Interface: The software is simple and straight forward. 
PC  software $ neg $ PC software that comes with the player is not as simple as i Tunes but its not bad at all. 
scroll bar $ neg $ The scrol bar agian takes some getting used to. 
storage  $ pos $ You can use the player to store your computer data files (Good feature to have).   
Battery $ pos $ Battery : A Big Big plus. 
battery usage $ pos $ Most of the other players I checked dont have user servicable battery. 
battery life $ pos $ Each battery lasts about 10-11 hours. 
battery charging $ pos $ Another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the USB cable.  
FM tuner $ pos $ FM tuner & Microphone : Having a tuner in the player is a blessing. 
FM reception $ neg $ Since zen does not have an external antena it has some problems catching weak signals but it works. 
microphone $ pos $ Builtin microphone is great for recording short voice notes. 
sound $ pos $ Sound: This is where I love Zen the most. 
sound $ pos $ Excellent sound I mean the player has juice. 
bass $ pos $ The bass treble the sound detail is awsome. 
player $ pos $ I compared it to other CD players (Two models of Panasonic, Rio & samsung) and they were no way even near Zen Micro.  
look $ pos $ Looks and shape: I have a black one and the first time I charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool. 
size $ pos $ Its compact and has rounded edges. 
size $ pos $ Fits well in hand in trouser pockets.   
belt clip $ pos $ Freebies you get: A cradle with detachable stand and belt clip, some thing very handy and useful. 
belt clip $ neg $ I dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem). 
headphones $ neg $ You get a USB cable headphones, a pouch, software except headphones you will like every thing else.  
headphones $ neg $ What I dont like: Nothing much except Headphones, Belt clip design. 
sound $ pos $ FM transmitter (belkin has a good one) to use Zen with your car Sterio FM Tunner   Latest Find: Connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to Ipod. 
player $ pos $ Thankfully, Creative has come through with a product that puts the Ipod back in its place.  
Zen micro $ pos $ While I have not had the "privilege", as many call it, of owning an Ipod, based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their Ipod (and subsequently purchased the Zen Touch or Zen Micro), I can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the Zen Micro was one of the more informed ones.
player $ pos $ By focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing, they have introduced a player that can look the Ipod straight in the eye and not flinch.  
Zen micro $ pos $ While I'm not too keen on their customer service (none of the products I have from Creative have given me issues), I can definitely recommend the Zen Micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more...without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth.  
look $ pos $ About the product:  The Zen Micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.  
size $ pos $ It fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed, doesn't look to ostentatious while I'm walking around with it.  
interface $ pos $ The interface, while a bit confusing at first, is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes.  
battery life $ pos $ Battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.  
file transfer $ pos $ Transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.  
organizer $ pos $ Also, I am quite partial to the Creative MediaSource Organizer and Player software, which I had with Audigy ZS sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.  
design $ pos $ All-in-all, Creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and I look forward to the Nomad/Zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.  
configuration $ neg $ P.S.  The only snag I encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the Micro to a front USB port.  The bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power; after connecting it to the rear ports, it works perfectly.     
look $ neg $ This device looks pretty nice but it's really not very competitive.  
player $ neg $ The iPod mini is smaller and sexier, albeit limited in supported formats and the Rio Karma is a far better value.  
storage $ neg $ The karma is only $5 more, it's small, had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including ogg.  
look $ neg $ The karma doesn't look as sexy but it's interface is very efficiently designed.  
functioning $ pos $ Initially, I was very impressed, after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this, I then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright. 
auto load $ neg $ After a week I tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn't do anything but turn on my player. 
software $ neg $ It seems like the software is just not responding. 
support $ neg $ The support has been less than impressive, considering the cost. 
support $ neg $ I'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops I jumped through (emails, downloads, reboots, a purge and another download, plus reading through the help menu) a refund should be twice as frustrating.     
storage $ pos $ The extra GB of hardrive space, removeable battery and FM tuner, as well as the fact that I was previously a satisfied owner of the Nomad II put it over the top for me. 
working $ pos $ Fortunately for me, I have yet to have a single problem with this player.  
interface $ pos $ I think the OS and controls are very well thought out and although I'll admit I was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the Micro, the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so. 
manual $ pos $ However, there is a more detailed PDF manual on the CD (and online) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the Zen Micro. 
software $ neg $ While the software may not be as easy as I-Tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch. 
loading speed $ pos $ As opposed to the Nomad II or any other flash based player, the songs load extremely fast...about one or two seconds per song. 
editing titles $ pos $ I also like the fact that you can edit your MP3 titles, etc. 
sound $ pos $ After comparing the included Creative earbuds directly against my Sony MD-E828LP's and Sennheiser MX-400's, I find myself still using the Creative's, which in my opinion, sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord.  
FM reception $ neg $ If I was pressed to find a negative aspect of the Zen Micro I would probably have to mention weak FM reception, but the building where I primarily use the Micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway, so you can take that for what it's worth.  
functioning $ neg $ It had issues right off the bat, with freezing up, staying in 'SHUTTING DOWN' mode, and just not functioning very well in general. 
touch pad $ neg $ The touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well, and as I never had issues getting songs transferred to the player, I did have problems accessing them from the player.   
make $ neg $ Many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> I would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well. 
player $ neg $ It is the 'first generation' of the player, and while I still agree that it is a great alternative to the iPod, I think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck.   
player $ neg $ If someone asked me flat out, i'd say to go woth something else.      
price $ pos $ Perhaps I bought the Micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from Amazon), the design, or avoiding the high iPod theft in NYC subways. 
player $ pos $ Whichever it may be, I'm happy I've made this purchase.  
size $ pos $ When I opened the box, I was shocked by the size of this thing... It's TINY! 
look $ pos $ It's shorter, sleeker, more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the iPod...My Nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy! 
interface $ pos $ The interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus. 
sound $ pos $ Moving on to sound department... It delivers! 
earbuds $ neg $ The earbuds, on the other hand, are decent in sound, but lacking in bass. 
earbuds $ neg $ I've since replaced it with a pair of black Sennheisers... Not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable, but are too similar to iPod's and can target iPod theives here in NYC. 
functionality $ neg $ Functionality, menus are easy to navigate... As many have mentioned, the touch pads take some time to get used to, but I've gotten used to it. 
design $ neg $ Although, I thought it could've been designed a bit better.  
extra features $ pos $ There are extra features packed inside this unit (some that most will hardly ever use) such as FM radio tuner, voice recorder, calendar, and alarm clock. 
battery usage $ pos $ Speaking of battery, it's removable AND replaceable! 
Micro $ pos $ Overall, the Micro is a solid device and I haven't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood*. 
storage $ neg $ It's perfect for those who aren't planning on storing tons of music. 
music transfer $ pos $ Transferring music is a breeze. I don't subscribe to music services, but as mentioned on other reviews, Micro allows you to subscribe to services OTHER than iTunes. 
features $ pos $ It may not top the iPod Mini, but it's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality.  
design $ pos $ Strong Points: - Design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish. 
sound $ pos $ You don't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a "special edition" to get black! - Sound: Awesome! - Batteries: removable/replaceable. 
audio formats $ pos $ - Audio Formats: supports both MP3, WMA... And yeah, WAV too.  
FM reception $ neg $ - Radio Quality: weak reception     
look $ neg $ It's nice that the Zen Micro has bells and whistles like FM (but where's AM???) and voice recording, and 20% more storage than "the other" mini MP3 player, but why is it so (...)ugly?  
color $ neg $ The colors are a joke, and I personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad. 
design $ neg $ But my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.  
audio $ neg $ What's the point of having "good audio" in your hand when your g/f thinks you have no taste whatsoever and your friends laugh their heads off while proudly showing off their iPod Mini?  
software $ neg $ Still has terrible software.  
software $ neg $ You have to wonder why Creative can't get this right.  
look $ neg $ Looks nice but the conrols are awkward and the entire front is touch sensitive.  
storage $ pos $ You do get 1 more GB than an iPod mini.  
screen review $ neg $ Screen review could be better.  
screen review $ neg $ Apple stil does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini.     
player $ pos $ This product is amazing and better than the Ipod you can get at the same price. 
storage $ pos $ the 4G Ipod costs the same as this 5G Zen Micro. 
features $ pos $ It also has a voice recorder and FM radio that you can only get on an Ipod if you but an adapter seperately. 
design $ pos $ Creative did an awesome job with the design. 
headphones $ pos $ The headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when I bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that I know doesn't come with every one. 
player $ pos $ I have the black one and adore it. 
look $ pos $ It looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black. 
size $ pos $ I bought my Zen Micro three months ago mainly because I preferred the size and style to the iPod mini. 
player $ pos $ Overall, I've been very impressed with the player. 
functioning $ pos $ I've had almost no problems with the firmware (ie, lock-ups, shut-downs etc), but I have kept the player up to date. 
firmware $ pos $ I'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its Li-Ion battery, the better firmware, or a combination of both factors. 
battery life $ pos $ I imagine if I left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.  
sync to windows media player $ pos $ One of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to Windows Media Player. 
speed $ pos $ Its just as fast as the included Creative software, but much less invasive, and overall better looking. 
touchpad $ pos $ The touchpad is great once you get used to it, and I much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels (as on the Dell DJ for example). 
touchpad $ pos $ They are sensitive and accurate (perhaps too accurate, it senses through t-shirt cloth, but the touchpad can be locked), but easy to clean, unlike buttons. 
touchpad $ pos $ Also, the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree.  
FM reception $ neg $ The FM radio's reception isn't spectacular, but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area. 
radio record $ pos $ Its ability to record radio is useful as well, but would have been moreso if it could be preset.  
look $ pos $ The player looks great, feels great, and sounds great. 
durability $ pos $ So far it has been very durable (other than the little pads on the earbuds), but those aren't really necessary as I find them comfortable on their own. 
earbuds $ pos $ They also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like Panasonics and Sennheisers. 
Zen micro $ pos $ This year, it seems that I choose my timing perfectly, having discovered the awesome device that is the Zen Micro.  
features $ pos $ Everything that I have listed above, the Zen has, and more. 
navigation $ pos $ The menus are easy to scroll through; they are laid out naturally, and make sense. 
interface $ pos $ The computer interface is 90% good, only losing points due to the fact that "Creative" branding is all over the place within it. 
transfer speed $ pos $ Songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time. 
features $ pos $ On the fly play list creation, address book, removable storage drive capabilities, sound recorder, the list goes on people, this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies, it was like Halloween all over again. 
design $ pos $ So far I have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.  
Zen $ neg $ 00% good though, and the Zen does have a few drawbacks. 
file transfer $ neg $ While transferring songs to the player, the interface has crashed a few times (4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period) normally this would cause me major concern, but it appears that this bug is reproducible, which leads me to believe that Creative will fix it with a patched version shortly (or maybe it's just my computer). 
response speed $ neg $ Another thing I don't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up. 
plaeyr $ pos $ That's it for now, what are you doing still reading this, click the "Add to Cart" button already!      
features $ pos $ Right out of the box, I loved it, better features than the Ipod, great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources I can use. 
player $ pos $ So, I was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all. 
warranty $ neg $ After consulting with Creative's customer support, they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair, which would cost me $40, since it's past the 90 day warranty (pretty short warranty). 
working $ neg $ Well, I got my second player, and right out of the box it wasn't working right and once again, after consulting customer se!
quality $ neg $ They obviously have quality and reliability problems. 
player $ neg $ They have a good concept here, and I normally expect a lot better quality from Creative, so maybe they will do better with the next gen version, but for now I say buyer beware.  
player $ pos $ ORIGINAL REVIEW December 2004 I'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their Zen Micro, but mine has worked great! 
player $ pos $ This is my first MP3 player and I am so impressed with what such a small device can do.  
sound $ pos $ I have ripped over 100 songs from my CD collection and it was so easy and fast, and they all sound great.  
interface $ neg $ es, the interface took a little getting used to, but once I did, it's almost second nature now.  
organization $ pos $ I love that you can create custom playlists, and organize music in so many different ways.  
WAV format $ neg $ Only slight negatives I've had so far is that I haven't been able to get it to accept any of my WAV files yet.  
case $ neg $ My other nit is that it didn't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything.  
belt clip $ neg $ Yes, there is a belt clip, but that doesn't hold the extra battery and usb cable.  
bag $ neg $ The little bag it comes with is cheap and useless.  
bag $ neg $ It barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzies all over the player, because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart.  
player $ pos $ I love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it.  
player $ neg $ It is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it.  
features $ pos $ The FM tuner, the 5G of storage, and the removable disk are all great features.  
look $ pos $ The fit and finish of the product is first-rate.  
interface $ neg $ On the downside, I think the interface takes some getting used to and the Zen software !
software $ neg $ is not as intuitive as I would like.  
earbuds $ neg $ Also, the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable (although my wife didn't have a problem), so I bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones.  
player $ pos $ Overall, I am very pleased with it.  
player $ pos $ The more I use it and figure out how to do things, the more I like it.     
sound quality $ pos $ Before you run out and buy an iPod, understand something: there are REASONS the Zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle, principally excellent (for MP3) sound quality.  
headphones $ pos $ The supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre iPod buds. 
size $ pos $ The player is smaller than you think. 
touchpad $ neg $ The touch pad is over-sensitive, and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive. 
sound quality $ pos $ Bottom line: If you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services, and are willing to deal with the possibility (not the certainty) of setup gremlins, by all means get the Zen Micro.     
software $ neg $ The machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is AWFUL. 
player $ neg $ After installation, the very first time I booted up the Creative MediaSource Organizer, intending to use its CD burning and ripping functions, it totally shorted out. 
working $ neg $ I was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work, to no avail. 
customer support $ neg $ Of course one of the first things I did was write an email to the customer support at Creative, through their website, and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless. 
player $ neg $ his is what I get for my $200 on this MP3 player?  
Zen micro $ pos $ The Zen Micro is near perfect.   
built $ pos $ It's still alive, still kicking, and still playing.   
windows compatibility $ pos $ The Zen Micro (mine's black) has a lot going for it.   
size $ pos $ It fits into a hand well, it has a removable battery (this is important), great sound quality, fm stereo, recorder, smooth UI, and a feature that most unipods lack... char!
work with WMP $ neg $ It wouldn't always work seemlessly with WMP and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it. 
accessories $ pos $ The accesories that come with the player are great. 
bag $ pos $ White earbuds ( i replaced those with some shure headphones, big difference), a case, a stand, a clip (which doesn't really work), and a nice little zen micro bag. 
player $ pos $ best in class. 
player $ pos $ It gives you the most bang for your buck, period.   
quality $ pos $ Creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and, yes, charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie.   
player $ pos $ Pick your favorite color and buy it.      
touch sensitivity $ neg $ As for the Zen Micro:\  Cons:  I read that every button is touch sensitive, and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front. 
durability $ neg $ Putting the Micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything (unless the hold feature is improved: it asks if you want to "unhold" for every button up press) Second, I'm worried about the durability of the player. 
durability $ neg $ After research of other creative hard drive players, i found that most of them aren't very durable and tend to crash (read most reviews on amazon.com and see for yourself). 
price $ neg $ Last, i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this. 
design $ pos $ Pros The Design is very nice, and the colors are too. 
features $ pos $ It also has tons more features then previous creative products, and most of them are very useful such as the ability to custimize the main menu to show the stuff you want, not the default items (creativelabs.com for more on that).  
battery $ pos $ The battery is also convenient, but could have been better, such as the Zen Touch's battery (but at least this one is removable).    
storage $ neg $ Verdict:  Had I not needed something with a tad bit more space, I consider this player fair game. 
player $ pos $ If you don't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive, I'd recomment buying it to try out, and also buy an extra 2 year warrenty for it (there are some offered here, for about $15 dollors I think).  
player $ pos $ anyway, my wife got this for me for my birthday and I love the thing. 
firmware $ pos $ the program is called Gnomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows sofware does. 
look $ pos $ +looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hardshell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +USB cable !
battery life $ pos $ +Battery life is awesome IF you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] OR make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +Awesome sound quality... I mean it is Creative right? 
navigation $ pos $ +Sorts music by artist, album, genre, etc... it's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you're looking for. 
scrollpad $ neg $ It DOES take some getting used to. 
charging $ neg $ whatever...  on to the negatives:  -touchy about charging... you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it's life if you don't upgrade the firmware OR dont' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side. 
button functioning $ neg $ It has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working? 
users guide $ neg $ -User's guide doesn't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website. 
heat $ neg $ ) -Can't be left in the car... it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long. 
size $ pos $ But since it's so small, it isn't a big deal to bring it with me.  
player $ pos $ Overall though, i'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player, even if it is to pretend your not a braindead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the iPod. ;)     
Napster 2 go compatibility $ pos $ I finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with Napster 2 Go....which is a subscription service, allowing me to download as much music as I want for a $14.95 flat fee.  
player $ pos $ And I must say...this MP3 is very cool.  
look $ pos $ It's so cute...and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue.   
installation $ pos $ After installation, which was VERY simple....I downloaded any updated software from the Creative website, before I downloaded any music.   
sound $ pos $ The sound is very nice.  
lock feature $ pos $ I also like the lock feature, so it makes the touch pad inactive.   
FM reception $ neg $ I tried to use the FM radio option, but it doesn't seem to really pick up the stations I listen, however I am going to try it in a different location, it may have just been my residential location.   
touchpad $ neg $ Even when I set it to low, it's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what I want it to do.  
player $ pos $ Otherwise, I am extremely please with the Creative Zen Micro 5GB MP3 player.    
Zen micro $ pos $ However after playing with it for three weeks now, I'm convinced, the Zen Micro is superior. 
sound quality $ pos $ I think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature, and the Zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality, with no need to upgrade the earphones. 
FM tuner $ pos $ I thought the FM radio would not see much use with so many tracks avaiable to me, but its great for tuning in to TV programs at the gym while on the treadmill, concerts and programs being simulcast, NPR, and on and on. 
scroll bar $ neg $ I've read about the issues with the scroll bar, but they must have taken care of that now. 
ease of usage $ pos $ Mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download. 
size $ pos $ Its also smaller, and gets more looks. 
extra features $ pos $ An extra gig of room, FM radio, voice recorder, PIM applications with sync to Outlook. 
player $ pos $ This is really a no brainer. 
features $ pos $ I purchased this over the Ipod Mini because it had several nice features: extra 1G storage, WMA support, replaceable battery, and especially that it wasn't an Apple product with their proprietary architecture.  
touchpad $ neg $ The Touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don't want. 
download speed $ neg $ Another problem is that the latest 2.0 firmware upgrade moves you into Windows Media Player 10 which seems to be very, very slow for downloads.  charging[-2] 
Outlook compatibility $ pos $ Better for the Zen Micro is Outlook compatibility. 
software $ pos $ Creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.  
additional accesories $ pos $ The Zen Micro is no exception: in addition to the case, it comes with a neck strap, and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging.  
player $ pos $ If I could, I'd trade-up on my Creative Muvo2 and snag a Zen Micro tomorrow.  
player $ pos $ This is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks.  
plug in $ pos $ I also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my AUX slot in the store's sound system.  
features $ pos $ Feature for feature, I find it a very sweet little player; equipped with a higher end headphone system, between this and th larger Zen Ihardly use my home stereo system anymore. 
Napster to go compatibility $ neg $ If you buying this player to use with Napster to Go, wait a while. 
firmware $ neg $ A lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for Napster to Go.. The firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it. 
player $ pos $ On the whole, I'm quite happy with the purchase.  
sound $ pos $ The sound is bright and clear, the ability to store any MP3's (and not just Apple-approved files) is great, and I plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time.    
look $ pos $ The device looks very cool, I think (exactly as the photos promise), it's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket, and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice.  
srorage $ pos $ No offense to Amazon, but I was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks (I'm sure prices here will continue to sink), and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space.    
radio feature $ pos $ I like some local stations, Stern, and NPR, and so the radio seemed like a great option.  
FM reception $ neg $ Imagine my disappointment, though, when the Zen Micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest FM signals in my area.  
FM reception $ neg $ It seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the Micro to pull in a strong sound.  
battery life $ neg $ The battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than Creative suggests.  
creative $ neg $ Still, that's enough time that I'm still satisfied, if a bit grouchy with Creative's overhyped promises.    
headphones $ pos $ Have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility.  
Zen micro $ pos $ eball metaphor: I was hoping Creative hit a home run here, and I think the Zen Micro is more like a stand-up double.  
player $ neg $ Respectable, solid, but not awe-inspiring.          
sound quality $ pos $ Actually, the Creative Zen Micro solves all that.  
sound quality $ pos $ Sound quality? Phenomenal. 
sound quality $ pos $ unarguably better than Apple's, and nice earbuds to boot.  
variety of colors $ pos $ Your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package.  
storage $ pos $ Five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums. 
construction $ pos $ Tough as nails. 
construction $ pos $ No skips, and it hasn't faltered once (despite your inevitable drop or two.
compatibility $ pos $ Flawless. 
play WMA $ pos $ ) No locked-in proprietary business like Apple; this baby plays WMAs too.  
voice record $ pos $ The voice recorder is a beautiful add-on; not even necessary, but just an example of why Apple just wants your money and Creative Labs wants to make a better player. 
sound $ pos $ Gets nice sound too. 
FM tuner $ pos $ The FM tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake.  
player $ pos $ In conclusion, this player is beautiful. 
ease of use $ pos $ Power for the tech-savvy, ease of use for the less fortunate. 
player $ pos $ But it; you won't regret it.     
player $ pos $ This player is absolutely phenomenal, I haven't had any problems, and if you're worried you will have problems, I suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways... I find the touch pad very easy to use, and I'm surprised so many people have had problems.  
sound quality $ pos $ The sound quality is superb, much better than that of an iPod, in my opinion.  
radio $ pos $ The radio works excellent in my area, I'm not sure everywhere else.  
software $ pos $ The software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!  
battery $ pos $ I'm not gonna go into the features cause if you're reading this review, you've probably already looked at them, but I must say the DJ feature if Very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus!  
look $ pos $ The blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also.  
price $ pos $ t simply the best player on the market for a really low price, so why look anywhere else?      
player $ pos $ I've had it for about a week now and have to say it's one of the best purchases I've ever made.  
look $ pos $ it's a great looking, easy-to-use device but it's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my Sony mini-disc player.  
interface $ pos $ I have no problems with the touch pad (once the sensitivity is set to low) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the PDF manual.  
Media player compatibility $ pos $ Why bother when it works perfectly with Media Player 10?  
battery life $ neg $ where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).  
battery life $ neg $ I would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.  
storage $ pos $ The extra Gb is just a bonus.  
headphones $ neg $ The headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "ear buds".  
sound $ pos $ If your looking for a great sounding mini player, you can't go wrong with the Zen Micro.     
player $ neg $ Unfortunately I was wrong.  
player $ neg $ Within one month, my player completely died. 
touchpad $ neg $ (It had locked up multiple times previously, but always managed to work afterwards) This time, the touch screen wouldn't respond to me and none of the buttons worked. 
working $ neg $ So I took out the battery and put it back in again, only to find that it would not work.  
sound $ neg $ I had the second one for less than two weeks when I noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played.  
customer service $ neg $ I sent Creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don't seem to even want to help.  
design $ pos $ It was a good player when it worked and I loved the design.  
player $ neg $ It's too bad, though, that !
Zen micro $ pos $ The Creative Zen Micro, at first glance, is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers. 
battery $ pos $ The Zen offered a great alternative. 
software $ pos $ It's easy to use, and makes transfering your CD collection to the player a cinch. 
sound quality $ pos $ The clarity is unbelievable, which means you can cram almost the full 2,5!
sound quality $ pos $ Other mp3 players won't give you the sonic clarity of the Zen at this compression level, so I imagine they won't at lower ones, either. 
headphones $ neg $ The included headphones suck, so get your own.         
trnasfer $ pos $ Transfering MP3s are a cinch with the included software. 
format $ pos $ The Zen plays mp3, wma and wave formats, which makes it more versatile than the Ipod. 
software $ pos $ The greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your CD info. 
organization $ pos $ Track $, name, artist, album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled, and properly catergorized into the Zen. 
labling $ pos $ rks almost without fail, no matter what your taste in music is: From relaxation music to hard rock, to hip hop, to Korean and Japanese, to Afro-Cuban and Salsa, Jazz, Blues, Country and Pop, this feature performs well. 
touch screen $ neg $ The touch sreen navigation will take a little getting used to, but once you do, and while the Zen is still alive, it's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies. 
FM reception $ neg $ just too numerous to list: FM radio, which has weak reception, but at least it there, and a microphone, to name just two. 
touchpad light $ pos $ Oh, and another is the cool "halo" light that surrounds the touch pad, and light's up when you touch the screen, and how the light glows when the Zen is connected to the computer. 
design $ neg $ But, the Creative Zen Micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and I'm going to tell you what it is...But first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial IPOD killer.         
size $ pos $ One: It's size: It's smaller than the Ipod Mini, and holds more music (5GB to the IPOD mini's 4GBs). 
battery $ pos $ Two: it has a removeable/rechargeable battery, so you don't have to send the thing in when the re!
design $ neg $ But, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: After 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything. 
headphone jack design $ neg $ because the "engineers" at Creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack. 
headphone jack $ neg $ Again, the headphone jack on this thing is garbage. 
headphone design $ neg $ Again, this is a design flaw in the headphone!
Zen $ neg $ The flaw is inside the Zen. 
headphone jack $ neg $ The flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to. 
Zen micro $ neg $ The Creative Zen Micro is a Zen Micro killer, not an Ipod killer. 
storage $ neg $ Why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20GB iPod that will hold 4 times the number of songs (and even MORE if AAC encoding is used) for the same price???  
audio quality $ pos $ This player is fantastic in terms of audio quality, ease of use, and features. 
usage with subscription service $ neg $ To use the Creative Zen player with a subscription service, you need to go to Creative's web site, and download new software for your PC. 
set up $ neg $ I haven't seen any problems yet, but if you don't like to tinker a bit, this player can be a little challenging to set up.  
subscription WMA $ neg $ This doesn't affect standard MP3 files - just subscription WMA files. 
transfer speed $ neg $ The subscription files are still a little slower to transfer, but it's only by about 10% or so.  
subscription DRM-encoded $ neg $ Again, this doesn't affect regular MP3 files - just subscription DRM-encoded files, like those from Napster-to-Go or Yahoo Music Unlimited.  
player $ pos $ Otherwise, this is a great "alternative" MP3 player for those of use who don't want to worship the mighty all-powerful Apple. 
player $ pos $ I got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from Yahoo (Music Unlimited,) and despite the above issues, I love it. 
creative $ pos $ I have owned some kind of Creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support.  
player $ pos $ The main issue now is that this new Zen Micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily.  
interface $ pos $ It beats Apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and I personally like its interface more than the Ipod scroll wheel.  
audio quality $ pos $ Further, the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the Ipod.  
player $ pos $ I have had several MP3 players over the past few years, and have to say that this by far is the best that I've owned. 
features $ pos $ However, the Ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'Zen Micro' has to offer.   
storage $ pos $ Some features that the 'Zen Micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5G hard drive...actually an SD flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with Microsoft Outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (I can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs. 
construction $ pos $ sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90), the ability to record with a built-in microphone (great for recording reminders and meetings), very sturdy construction, and not to mention...the sound quality is excellent!  
user interface $ pos $ As far as user interface is concerned, the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player, 'Creative MediaSource Organizer'. 
converter $ pos $ This program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another. 
formats $ pos $ These include: MP3, Wave, WMA, WMA Pro, and WMA Lossless; it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file(s) to be converted. 
Creative zen Micro $ pos $ By far this seems to be the best value out there for the money; if you are undecided, the Creative Zen Micro seems to be the best choice.     
on $ neg $ I don't know, maybe I got a defective one but first, the player would not shut off, next, the player would not come on - I had to send it away to get repaired.  
ear phone jack $ neg $ Now, the player's ear phone jack is not working - I have to send it away again.  
player $ pos $ When it's working, it's great but it is very tempermental.   
router $ pos $ This router does everything that it is supposed to do, so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it. 
setup $ pos $ It was a very quick setup and installation, in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up. 
install $ pos $ By no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it, just be able to put a CD in the computer and it tells you what to do. 
works $ pos $ It works great, i am usually at the full 54 mbps, although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is. 
router $ pos $ It really is a great buy if you are lookin at having just one modem but many computers around the house. 
router $ pos $ There are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router, and everybody is happy with it. 
setup $ pos $ Its the easiest thing to setup i thought, and i am only 16...So with all that said, BUY THE ROUTER!!!!     
install $ neg $ It's probably a fine router, but I found the install wizard to be of poor quality.  
Wizard $ neg $ The Wizard is particularly sinister. 
wizard $ neg $ It just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router (mine does), without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired PC or a wireless equipped PC. 
setup $ neg $ The box proudly displays "SecureEasySetup (TM)" "Wireless Made Simple" "One Touch Setup Button" "Easy Start" "Easy Security" "Easy Everyday"   Apparently Linksys/Cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial. 
router $ pos $ I recently bought the Linksys WRT54G router and have been very happy with the router itself. 
configuration $ neg $ HOWEVER, configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours, and briefly made me reconsider my choice to forego the airport and its notoriously easy setup. 
CD $ neg $ Too bad they don't mention anything about how the CD can't be used with a Mac. 
user manual $ neg $ I even downloaded the product's user manual - useless. 
technical support $ neg $ The Linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a Mac. 
instruction $ neg $ I say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working, but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that I could have done if so!
documentation $ neg $ What this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS!
setup $ neg $ * I'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable. 
product $ pos $ But the product iself is great.  
router $ pos $ Once you set it up, it's great. 
well-priced $ neg $ And it is EXTREMELY well-priced for what you're getting. 
performance $ pos $ Another 5 star performance. 
CD $ pos $ This setup using the CD was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time. 
speed $ pos $ Pertaining to the speed issue: I got 54Mps while I was in the same room. 
works $ pos $ This router works at 54Mbps that's megabyte not kilobyte. 
running $ pos $ I hooked the Linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus Kilobytes on the download e!
Broadband $ pos $ Broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies. 
Installation $ pos $ Installation was as near automatic as can be. 
equipment $ pos $ All in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment. 
WEP encryption $ neg $ I had some issues when I had enabled WEP encryption and then moved on to WPA. 
connectivity $ pos $ Even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity.  
firmware update $ pos $ New firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration. 
configuration $ pos $ All you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network. 
router $ pos $ Awesome for the newbie, though I personally like to fasten every bolt myself.  
installation $ pos $ Comes with a installation CD which instructs you step by step to setting up the router. 
setting up $ pos $ You need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network.  
costlier $ neg $ Linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of Cisco. 
instructions $ neg $ There were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a softcopy manual, it did not give an answer readily on what do to.  
security $ neg $ The only other problem was that security for the wireless connection.  
works $ pos $ The router works fine for both wired and wireless.  
connect $ pos $ I can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly.  
connect $ pos $ Overall, if you know what basic steps to take, it was not difficult to connect, and the s/w worked well to connect.  
CD $ neg $ little to no networking experience, just in case the automatic CD method has issues.  
router $ pos $ I'd give it 4.5 stars if possible, but since 5 stars would be misleading, I give it 4 stars.     
enterprise piece $ neg $ This is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment. 
router $ pos $ I have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it. 
hardware version $ neg $ The new hardware version does not run Linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half. 
WRT54G $ pos $ just want a wireless router for home or your very small business, you can just get a WRT54G from here and configure it. 
WRT54G $ pos $ I would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something, but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router, just get the WRT54G.     
CD $ neg $ I tried the CD setup program without any luck.  
1-800 $ neg $ Yes, the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in India, but the guy was easy to understand, and he helped solve the problem. 
CD $ neg $ Essentially, the CD included with the package is, for the most part, worthless.  
product $ pos $ It'll make life a lot easier, and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review.  
router $ pos $ This is my fourth Linksys product and, aside from the rough start, I'm very satisfied with this router.     
router $ pos $ This linksys router does it for the RIGHT PRICE. 
range $ pos $ The range is terrific, I am using this for my home and I was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard.
WRT54G $ pos $ I've since gotten the Linksys Modem (BEFCMU10) and stacked it with the WRT54G router and it works fantastic!!! 
set up $ pos $ It took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn't called me yet with any problems. 
instructions $ pos $ there are instructions to encrypt your personal wirless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth. 
installation $ pos $ And the tech writers have made the installation process SO EASY for people lik my aunt to follow. 
product $ pos $ A very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years. 
security $ pos $ I upgraded from an older 801.11b router to the Linksys WRT54G for its improved security, and of course, speed. 
router $ neg $ However, this product performed well below my expectation.  
stream $ neg $ The Achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music, or copy large files over the local network.  
design $ neg $ After some research on the Net, I discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current WRT54G design (WRT54G, version 3, which Amazon currently sells).  
security $ pos $ As I mentioned in my first paragraph, it supports WPA security, which is far superior to WEP.  
setup $ pos $ In addition it is very easy to setup.  
use $ pos $ anted to rate the router higher than 1 star, due to its security, easy of use, etc.  
works $ pos $ So far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections.  
setup $ pos $ The setup was very easy. 
instructions $ pos $ Just follow the instructions carefully, it's all based on a CD that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time. 
design $ pos $ The dual anteanna is a plus and the design is slick.   
signals $ pos $ drops and strong signals even from the backyard. 
security $ pos $ The WRT54G offers excellent security features and much more (and easier) configuration menu that I didn't even need a manual to setup correctly.  
Linksys $ pos $ Even though you could get a cheap router these days, I'm happy I spent a little extra for the Linksys. 
quality $ pos $ The quality is significant and you'll be very happy from saving time and the headache.      
working $ pos $ I got it working fast enough.  
router $ pos $ It is a nice router in all ways but one.  
reliable $ neg $ It is not reliable.  
access $ neg $ A couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet. 
access $ neg $ That is, you cannot access the internet at all.  
router $ neg $ Very annoying.    
Broadcom hardware $ pos $ I also wanted to switch to Broadcom hardware (which the linksys uses) because my WiFi MiniPCI card in my dell laptop with lucent silicon in it used 70% of my 1.2Ghz laptop's CPU when using the wireless at full speed.  
CD $ neg $ The installation software CD crashed repeatedly. 
connection $ neg $ I then tried to set up the router through Linksys's browser interface, but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation CD, I had little luck - I did manage to connect briefly, but the connection kept dropping, and with no idea of how to resolve THAT issue, I gave up.   
wizard $ neg $ I couldn't get the install wizard to work.  
instructions $ pos $ However, setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze.  
install $ pos $ It's easy to install the security on this product but Linksys doesn't do a good job of explaining why its important.  
wizard $ neg $ Knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it.     
Linksys $ pos $ While I am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time, my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than Linksys.  
install $ pos $ The new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process. 
support $ pos $ Unlike other reviewers, I have found the support to be responsive, almost no wait time on the phone, and relatively knowledgeable. 
priced $ pos $ Overall, this router seems like a reasonably priced product th!
products $ pos $ at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support.     
works $ pos $ It's easy and really works, with some incredible range.  
Compatibility $ pos $ Compatability with other devices is excellent too; I've only found one 11b device that won't work with its mixed mode (and it won't work with *anyone's* mixed mode).
Setup $ pos $ Setup in XP was instant and intuitive. 
pipeline $ pos $ The main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients. 
quality $ pos $ Linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding.     
installation $ pos $ My experience with installation was quite good.  
installation $ pos $ I upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my Sony VAIO laptop (XP operating system).  
wizard $ pos $ The card basically installed itself and the "install wizard" on the CD that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer (with the 54g card) and also a second computer in my house (with an 11b card).  
setup $ neg $ The setup wasn't quite perfect the first time -- I needed to go through a web-based interface to set up the router (to give  it info on my DSL provider account), though the documentation for this was staightforward.  
set up $ pos $ I haven't tried to set up any advanced features on the router, but it is not difficult to set up for basic use.  
documentation $ pos $ The documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- I needed a lot of help from Linksys technical assistance to set that one up.  
router $ pos $ I like this router a whole lot better the Linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much stroners, seldom falling below the "very good" range (and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router.  
transmission speed $ pos $ The transmission speed is also quite good, with pages loading very quickly.  
backward $ pos $ I have had no problem either with backward compatiaibility, in that the "mixed mode" feature lets you both 54 and 11 Mb cards off the router.     
router $ pos $ As far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the G standard was introduced to the market. 
use $ neg $ I like the fact that it IS EASY to use with limited networking experience- the problem I have is that there are many useless features on the unit, and some wanted features, like a list of computers accessing my wireless, is not easily found on my router.   
router $ pos $ All in all, it's a good router if you don't have the cash for a Speedbooster one. 
router $ pos $ I just replaced my old Linksys router with this one, turned everything on in the right order, and it was up and running with no problems.  
set up $ pos $ All of the wireless components that I bought were a breeze to set up as well.     
product $ pos $ This product is by far the best Broadband Router on the market, I bought this to replace one of those Linksys Instant Wireless B routers, worked great for about a year. 
range $ pos $ My opion is concentrate on what you need now, This product has EXELENT range, holds a teady connection, hasent even droped one and i have it for more than a month now. 
ROUTER $ pos $ IF YOU NEED A WIRELESS ROUTER.... GET IT GET IT GET IT.... works really good....     
product $ pos $ I was an early purchaser of the WRT54G, and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally, the March 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product!
satellite $ neg $ It took me three days, to the tune of Neil Young's song "Piece Of Cr--!", to get this to work with the satellite hookup I was hired to connect this wireless network up to.  
tech support $ neg $ There is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "knowledge" database at linksys.com, and first tech support person I spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour, then gave me a web site address to consult--that turned out to be the one I'd already found during a search of my own.  
quality $ pos $ I just upgraded to the Linksys WRT54G Wireless-G router last month and I am very happy with the quality of the product.  
multipurpose $ pos $ This router acts as a wireless access point, 100 MB switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device.  
connection $ neg $ I was having intermittent problems with it losing connection. 
setup $ pos $ The inital setup of the router was simple. 
Works $ pos $ Works pretty well. 
DHCP $ pos $ The best part about this router is now I have a DHCP server. 
product $ neg $ This is a good product, but the Linksys 54g desktop card is not.  
desktops $ neg $ I'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop, but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until Linksys improves their desktop software/hardware.     
Linksys $ pos $ My brother had an old Linksys B band wireless router in his home and it was like magic. 
documentation $ neg $ Unfortunately, Linksys does not write the best documentation.  
Linksys $ pos $ Well Linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry.  
reliability $ pos $ ying to point out they have experience, and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best.  
model $ pos $ This model appears to be especially good.  
set up $ neg $ I tried to do this by instinct and it's not intuitive unless you are a network geek. 
works $ pos $ The darn thing works as promised and it's amazingly cheap too. 
work $ pos $ If you want to work wirelessly, this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now.             
setup $ pos $ The setup was a breeze, I had some reservations about a wireless network (see my review for linksys wet11)but this item was on sale as well as the WET11 so I just had to splruge. 
set up $ pos $ To set up the xbox, wap, and ethernest bridge, with the encryption on was less then 30 mins. 
setup software $ pos $ The setup software did everything. 
router $ pos $ In a week of use i've never had to reboot the router. 
speed $ pos $ A decent peice of hardware with great speed (I get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem)  and good signal quality. 
look $ pos $ I guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler. 
speeds $ pos $ I am getting better speeds on all my web programs. 
router $ pos $ There seem to be fewer collisons and dropped packets as I read from the router logs than with my old Dlink router. 
setting $ neg $ I had a lot of problems setting it up, since the software given along with it is buggy. 
firmware $ neg $ The firmware has bugs too, so download and install the latest firmware from Linksys. 
instant setup $ neg $ The instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually. 
router $ neg $ This is NOT a router I would suggest for a novice user, my old Dlink DI52!
VOIP $ pos $ It works well with my VOIP adapter, which is also a Linksys. 
connection $ neg $ The internet connection would go down every 5 mins when I used it with a P2P program called Bitspirit.  
Speed $ pos $ Pros.1.Speed  2. Signal Strength  3.Advanced Configuration Options
Customer service $ neg $  So-So 1. Customer Service - 6 calls Half were efficient other half were equally incompetent.  
disconnecting $ neg $ Both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best. 
junk $ neg $ Stay away from this junk. 
router $ pos $ Purchased this router a few months back, NO PROBLEMS whatsoever.  
WPA encryption $ pos $ In fact, it supports the new WPA encryption standard, which is WAY better than WEP.  
Works $ pos $ Works perfectly with my netgear wireless PCMCIA. 
Feature $ pos $ Feature wise, its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there.     
software $ neg $ Was a bit wary because the software is Windows only and I have an iMac. 
working $ pos $ Reset the network, tried the connection, and it's working like a charm. 
Tivo $ neg $ The downside being that the Tivo can only connect at 802.11b speeds and not 802.11g. 
backward compatible $ pos $ However since this Router is backward compatible, that doesn't pose a problem at all.  
connectivity $ pos $ Overall, it'll make my move that much easier knowing I don't have to worry about connectivity.     
logging $ neg $ (...)  Like most SOHO routers, it has nearly non-existant logging. 
reliable $ pos $ For more than a year, and it is totally reliable.  
signal $ pos $ No down time, great signal strength.  
features $ pos $ There is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features.  
Setup $ pos $ Setup is totally breeze and Linksys's web site is pretty easy to navigate.  
cheapest $ neg $ Now this router is not the cheapest on the market.  
firmware $ pos $ The fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion. 
router $ pos $ So the pretty solid router all around good for the money  here's the link to firmware updates http://www.sveasoft.com/forum6.html      
working $ pos $ Absolutely no problems with this router. 
instructions $ pos $ I downloaded and updated the firmware, and followed the easy setup instructions. 
customer support $ pos $ A call to customer support (got to a live person within a couple of minutes) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance.  
Speed $ pos $ Speed is not a problem.      
works $ pos $ After upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine. 
Linksys $ pos $ As far as Linksys goes, I have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems.     
setup $ pos $ Getting the router setup in a "vanilla" configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy, and I was able to do this no problem.
CD $ pos $ Second, the setup CD actually worked perfectly. 
installation $ pos $ I still need to read up on some of the security settings, etc to fully understand all that's up there, but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the Speedboost router. 
performance $ neg $ The performance of the router itself deserves 5 stars, but the Linksys documentation and support is so poor that I can only give it 4. 
manual $ neg $ Even the PDF manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "MAC settings", etc. 
antenna $ pos $ When I saw a high gain (low price) antenna was available to the WRT54G router, I thought I'd happily give up some (practically unattainable anyway, since you've got to be in spitting distance from the router) speed in favour of wider coverage. 
signal $ pos $ Having done all this, I was quite pleased to see that all corners I needed were decently covered by the signal. 
speed $ pos $ The box is upstairs, and in the farthest room I get connected at 11-18M speed - that is similar to the older 10M ethernet standard. 
signal $ pos $ Apart from speed, the signal is consistent and works without interruptions, etc. 
coverage $ pos $ the WRT54G plus the HGA7T is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case.     
router $ neg $ We bought this about 6 months ago and it's been worthless.  
connection $ neg $ It constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like WALLS in our house block the link so everything is very slow.  
support $ neg $ The tech support is worthless too.     
features $ neg $  There isn't much features on the iPod at all, except games.
sound $ pos $ SOUND QUALITY: The iPod's sound quality is pretty good.
equalizer $ neg $  It has an equalizer, but the iRiver H10-20GB has a lot more presets than the iPod. 
bass $ pos $ The bass is deep and the treble is clear.
battery $ neg $   DURABILITY: Not good. First problem, if you haven't seen the news recently, the iPods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months.
Replaceable battery $ neg $ Also, the battery's AREN'T USER REPLACEABLE.
flip side $ neg $  Another thing you should know, the metal on the flip side of the iPod is very tacky, and scratches very easily.
case $ neg $  Also, not liking the gel case. 
features $ neg $  FEATURES: Really, there aren't any features, unless you call the games a feature. 
FM tuner $ neg $ There is no FM tuner, while there is no FM tuner on the Creative Zen (on the micro version of the Zen there is a tuner), the iRiver H10-20GB, the Rio Karma, and the iAudio X5 have FM tuners. 
voice recording $ neg $  There is also no voice recording, something most if not all MP3 players have that the iPod doesn't.
photo viewing $ neg $  There is no photo viewing option, however, there is a 20 GB photo iPod, but it costs $20 more.
use $ pos $   EASE OF USE/DESIGN: The iPod is a very easy to use MP3 player, and if you can't figure this out, you shouldn't even own one.
iTunes $ neg $ I'm probably the only person that dislikes the iTunes software. 
CUSTOMER SERVICE $ neg $  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Awful. Listen to this one, remember the battery statement I made earlier. 
technical service $ neg $  There technical service isn't helpful either; they just read what's on their website and charge you $50 (+ toll fees) to do it.
iPod $ neg $ OVERALL: I highly dislike the iPod, even though the sound quality and design is above-average. 
Ipod $ pos $ The Ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from Jobs and Company. 
Apple $ pos $ Long live Apple, long live Macs, and long live the Ipod!     
ipod $ pos $ I have an ipod and it is a great buy. 
sturdy $ pos $  Very sturdy and strong.
games $ neg $  Doesn't have alot of good games on it.
iPod $ neg $ iPod is brilliant, but service was awful
iTunes $ pos $ The software with the iPod includes iTunes, which allows you to play the music on your computer, rip CDs onto your computer, and move your music from the computer to the iPod. 
click wheel $ pos $ This new click wheel iPod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection.  
song quality $ pos $  The song quality of the iPod is excellent, and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory, for most users.
scratches $ neg $  The back of the iPod is in a chrome finish, and this surface is prone to scratches. 
Battery life $ pos $  Battery life keeps improving on the iPod, and a new iPod will give you up to twelve hours of play time, per charge. 
Apple $ pos $ Thank you Apple!  You make fabulous products. 
product $ pos $  The product I rate five stars, 
service $ neg $ but I had to give you four because the service for my brand-new iPod was terribly slow.
Amazon $ pos $   Plus, if you order from Amazon.com, they will exchange it for you no problem.  
interface $ neg $  The interface took a little getting used to.
display $ pos $  This one has a color display, which I like a lot, being very visual. 
photos $ pos $ I loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and, very importantly, the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous. 
sound $ pos $  The sound is just fine. 
adapter $ pos $ It comes with an adapter to plug into the wall, which I hear is a step up from the other iPods, which require you plug it into a computer to charge it.  
photo quality $ neg $  One caveat I have is that I understand the iPod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved.
Hard Drive $ pos $  Pros: Large Hard Drive for the $$-- 20GB and 40GB are both affordable. 
Screen $ pos $ Decently Sized Screen-- One of the larger ones on the market at 2" 
Battery $ pos $ Decent Battery-- On the average size, but the 40GB comes with a dock.  
FireWire $ pos $  FireWire & USB2.0-- For those fortunate enough to have FireWire400, your in for a real treat with autosync.
Design $ pos $  Great Design-- Very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied (vertal ones are the only competition); and now the wheel clicks, taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus. 
sound $ pos $ Good sound-- Plays very nicely, even though the stock headphones are kind of weak Durable-- not the most durable because its mostly plastic, but very compact and sturdy 
Games $ pos $ Games-- not really important, but existant 
Hold $ pos $ Hold Button-- suprisingly not all MP3s have this; this allows you  to have all the buttons unusable, so that you don't accidently hit something in your pocket. 
Radio Tuner $ neg $  Cons: No AM/FM Radio Tuner-- Something a large number of competetors are doing
Voice Recorder $ neg $ 3 No Voice Recorder-- this has also become an important and popular feature that the iPod unfortunately doesn't have.
Memory Stick slots $ neg $  No Memory Stick slots-- Although a rare feature, it would be nice to have extra storage, not that it needs it Built-in Lithium Battery-- A huge hassle to bring this back; draining the battery once you get it helps, but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
iTunes $ pos $ . iTunes-- this is a love-hate relationship program; usually people with Mac like this program than people with a PC, but depending on your computer expertise, this could be a difficult program to use, and it is required for an iPod. 
accessories $ neg $ No inbox accessories-- An arm strap, belt strap, case, or anything would be nice, but nope... Moveable parts-- This makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th; with moveable parts, its easy to damage an iPod at a gym, so this is for more casual listeners; note the iPod Mini doesn't have moveable parts and is made of titanium.
Overall $ pos $   Comments: Overall this is still a great value, but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market.
Versatile $ pos $ Versatile and stylish.         
design $ pos $ I had a Casio unit, which had given great service, and would have been happy to get another one, but was tempted by the iPod's sleek design, storage capacity, connection options- - firewire and USB, and its integration with iTunes.   
battery $ neg $ The battery issue is superficially a concern, but any reasonable solder-jockey (such as myself :-) can pop in a new one when the time comes (based upon the plentiful info gained from a google for 'ipod battery replacement').   
controls $ pos $ The controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed  
iPod $ pos $  The iPod is a very nice product, which given reasonable care, should give a lot of service.      
iPod $ neg $  First, let me say that I got the 20gb iPod for Christmas, and I most likely would not have spent the $300 myself. 
battery $ neg $ In addition, I do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours, and it can take four hours for a full charge.
quality $ pos $  I have about 6 gb used on my iPod so far (well over 1000 songs), and as far as I can tell, all of them play at near-cd quality.
interface $ pos $ Other than the fact that one can't delete a file directly from the iPod, the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use.  
iTunes $ pos $  As for iTunes, I don't find it to be as good as the Windows Media Player as a computer mp3 player, but it is good enough. 
iPod $ pos $  In conclusion, I gave the iPod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly.
sensitive $ neg $  *The ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily. 
Battery $ neg $ The Battery does not last 12 hours.  
battery $ neg $  You can't change the battery, so I don't know what I'm going to do in a year or so.
volume $ neg $   *        You can't turn the volume up very high, but I think this might be for health reasons. *        
freezes $ neg $ My ipod freezes occasionally, which is especially annoying when you're in the middle of a game of "brick." *
apple $ neg $ If you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged, they charge you roughly $105.50 per minute and blame you for "abusing" your ipod.
support service $ neg $  The user support service isn't too great either.  
iPod $ pos $ Everything I Wanted! The Apple iPod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason.
design $ pos $  Its sleek design, large memory capacity, compatibility with iTunes, and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market. 
capacity $ pos $  Unless you have an enormous music/audio book library, the 20 GB model should have more than adequate storage capacity, with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs.  
wheel $ pos $  Features: click wheel to navigate; ability to work with Windows or Mac; optional backlighting (you can have it on all the time, or have it shut off to save battery power after 5, 10, or 20 seconds); ability to download PDA info; automatic or manual download from iTunes when iPod is plugged into your computer. 
equalizer $ pos $ There's even an equalizer (under "settings") that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic, bass booster, bass reducer, classical, dance, "deep", and electronic.
accessories $ pos $   With accessories, you can make the iPod into a digital recorder, broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology, and play it through your car speakers using either a CD adaptor or FM stereo broadcaster. 
reformatted $ neg $  The iPod comes formatted for the Mac, but within seconds of plugging it into a PC, is automatically reformatted for Windows.  (The HP version comes with Windows formatting, and takes seconds to change to Mac.) Although the iPod can be changed from one format to another, you will lose all of your music and data when doing so. 
ITunes $ pos $ ITunes can be downloaded from the enclosed CD or for free from the Apple site.    
steel backing $ neg $  Its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily, not great from a cosmetic standpoint.  
device $ pos $ All in all, this is a wonderful device.  
weight $ neg $   The weight is heavier than many digital players, but I like the solid feel. 
scratch $ neg $ Holy cow! It really does scratch easily!        
scratches $ neg $   The thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage, except the inevitable scratches.
Apple $ pos $   Apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment, and surprisingly wasn't as expensive as its reputation normally holds.  
Apple $ neg $ Apple closed their island to anything that resembled Microsoft, and clearly let Napster know it could not use their products with Napster's services. 
Battery $ pos $  Battery non-issue. 
iPod $ pos $ Finally, compare the iPod to other players on a cost/Gb, and also consider ease of use. 
iPod $ pos $ The iPod is not overpriced compared to the market.
purchase $ pos $ This is the best purchase I've made in a very long time.
sound $ pos $ The sound is INCREDIBLE; very clean, very wide dynamic range of bass, mids and highs, and can be very loud if I turn it up full blast.
Versatile $ pos $ The Great And Versatile iPod         I love my iPod! 
sound $ pos $  The sound quality is excellent, accessing the music is easy, and the controls are generally well thought out. 
iTunes $ neg $ As a Windows user, I had to install the software including drivers and iTunes on my desktop, and this is the only area where I encountered a nuisance. 
iPod $ pos $  I still give the iPod five stars, though, as it could have been something I did incorrectly during the install (though I did follow the onscreen prompts) so I'll give Apple the benefit of the doubt.
battery $ pos $ The battery holds a charge for a very long time (maybe 15 or so hours of use) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with iPod use. 
outside finish $ neg $   My only complaint (really more of an observation) is that the outside finish of the iPod is rather delicate, so I am going to get a case for mine so it doesn't get all scratched up. 
quality of audio $ pos $ (It sure does look nice, though!)  I recommend this to any music lover anywhere: the quality of the audio is excellent, the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive, and the storage capacity and battery life are huge!     
iTunes $ pos $   Using the software iTunes is relatively simple, you just plug the USB cable in, wait your machine to detect the iPod and voila, any songs listed in your iTunes library will be transfered on over to the iPod.
amplifier $ pos $  And, with the iPods' full volume up, all you have to do is adjust your receivers' volume and your set, since the iPod itself acts as a strong amplifer of its' own.
proprietary $ neg $   If there were any complaints I have, they are marginal, but one is Apples' properietary set-up for music files, their incompatibility with other music services (i.e. Napster) is down right wrong.
iPod $ pos $   However after purchasing a 20 GB iPod it's clear to see the superiority. 
iPod $ pos $ For a sleeker, smaller and more "average" MP3 player the Nitrus is great but the iPod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful.
play WMA $ neg $  Also, some other MP3 players such as the Nitrus allow you to play WMA (Windows Media Audio) files, whereas the iPod does NOT. 
USING $ pos $ The actual experience of USING the iPod is magnificent.
design $ pos $  The design, as mentioned above, is sleek, cool and trendy (and I think trendy = good, but it's always hard to tell these days). 
battery $ pos $  The battery life lastes 12 hours, and charges quickly. (As mentioned above, the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all!) Once you've downloaded your music, you can access the tracks by artist, genre, album, composer (this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e.g. covers of songs), etc.
sound quality $ pos $  The!  sound quality is great. 
earphones $ pos $ The included earphones are pretty good - my advice? 
use $ pos $   The ease of use of the iPod is a major attribute.
hard drive $ pos $  With the iPod, you can also store documents and contact files (from programs such as Microsoft Outlook) when it's connected to your PC as an external hard drive. 
games $ pos $ Also included in the "games" section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs. 
storage space $ pos $   20 GB OR 40 GB?  The pros of the 40 GB: Comes with a "dock station" and double storage space (10,000 songs).
iPod $ pos $   Overall the iPod really is an almost flawless beast. The capacity in the 20 GB is more than I think most people would ever need and, for the price, I highly recommend it.
Itunes $ pos $ Everything else about the ipod is great, the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it.
Finding $ pos $ Finding all the albums, songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig (well 18 gig) worth of music.
sounds $ pos $   It all sounds great too. 
headphones $ neg $  As with most headphones that come with any type of music player,I recommend throwing these into the nearest river, unless you like having hard, round pieces of plastic in your ears. 
store $ pos $  You can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it.
BATTERY $ neg $ Because Steve Jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an UNREPLACABLE 18 MONTH BATTERY. 
batteries $ neg $   This was obviously a conspiracy as it is FREAKIN' EASY to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries!!
pay $ neg $ However, in my mind, $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 MONTHS. 
interface $ neg $  LOOKS AND DURABILITY: I realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface.  
scratches $ neg $ The biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin's player was relatively new, it was riddled with scratches.
BATTERY $ neg $  BATTERY: Compared to the other players on the market, the iPod has one of the worst batteries around.
iPod $ pos $          If, like me you simply want an iPod to play your mp3's, buy this one. 
reliability $ pos $ So reliability is the winner here for the iPod.
looks $ pos $ For looks, well iPod is head and shoulders better, both the iRiver and Creative Zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming iPod. 
package $ pos $  The iPod package comes with everything you need, the AC adaptor, firewire cable (quicker than USB, but slower than USB 2 which it also gives), those snazzy and powerfull headphones, and of course the player. 
design $ neg $  Maybe this new design is more durable than the last, but I kind of doubt it.  
scratch $ neg $  We can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong, and thus eliminate the need for third-party "iSkin" protective covers for an extra thirty bucks.
earbuds $ neg $ First of all, I've never been big on earbuds - they're just not that comfortable.
iPod $ pos $  These issues aside, the iPod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one, you can't be without one.
alternative $ neg $   And if you're a Mac user like me, they've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative.  
iTunes $ pos $ Also, you have to use it with iTunes - or they'll sue, dammit!  But iTunes is about as good as anything. 
player $ pos $  The player is great. 
battery  $ neg $  However, the battery life isn't as good as I would like. 
product $ pos $  Overall, this product is AWESOME. 
features $ pos $  All the "cool" features of the mini, but with 20GB instead of 5.  
use $ pos $  Really easy to use.
click wheel $ pos $  Has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousnds of songs and organizes them great.
helpline $ pos $  Has a great helpline.
USB $ pos $  They fix the problem and help you with whatever your I-Pod needs Comes with two USB ports and a charger.
I-Tunes $ neg $  They are EXTREMELY convient and you don't have to buy them seperately Has I-Tunes, which provides qulity music at low prices.
Breaks $ neg $   Cons Breaks easily. 
Hard drive $ neg $ Hard drive screws up occasionally
I-Pod $ neg $ The I-Pod is the best thing I have ever used. 
use $ pos $ I found that to be the most impressive thing about the iPod 'mini' - basically for ease of use, and the feel it gives. 
USB $ pos $  This unit comes with the USB/firewire cable as a standard item now. 
use $ pos $   I have transferred in about 2,400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the Ipod and iTunes. 
sound quality $ pos $ I was worried about what the sound quality would be like, but that seems to be just as good as the actual CD sound.
screen $ neg $ This is only a problem at night, during the day the screen is very easy to see. 
features $ pos $ I love the features on the iPod and the many things you can do with it. 
battery $ neg $  The only problem is the battery life.
battery $ neg $ Apple's iPod battery replacement service costs $100! 
arm band $ pos $ The arm band is fantastic and it doesn't budge even at the gym.  
design $ pos $ I love the slim design; the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky.  
sound $ pos $ The ear buds that come with it look cheap, but the sound quality is amazing. 
click wheel $ pos $   The click wheel is incredibly convenient, however it can be a little overly touchy at times, which will make you frustrated with your own fingers.  
iTunes $ pos $  I am a big fan of iTunes, simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - IF you are buying the songs from the iTunes site.  
Apple $ pos $  Way to go Apple!  
iPod $ pos $ I rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism, but something about the iPod made me say, in the words of Lou and Andy, "I WANT THAT ONE!" I was willing to shell out 
performed $ pos $ I purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the CMT people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed.
adjustment $ neg $ The adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, I have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
collet $ neg $ The collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out.
use $ neg $ Then the most disappointing was trying to use Viper raised panel bits that just barely fit, and I mean just barely.
price $ pos $ From the Internet, woodworking books, local stores and personal opinions the Hitachi M12V 3-1/4 HP router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price.
power $ pos $ But I wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits.
power $ pos $ The Hitachi has plenty of power, runs smooth, and cuts effortlessly through maple (with Freud bits!)
bigger $ neg $ However, it is much bigger, bulkier, and heavier than my other router and I would not like to use it freehand (I keep it mounted in a table).
plunge $ pos $ Since I use it in a table, I don't use the plunge feature, but if I ever need it I've got it.
price $ neg $ The Hitachi is a great router for a great price, but only get it if you need the maximum power, variable speed and use it in a table.
use $ neg $ Otherwise, get a smaller single speed router, which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits.
looked $ pos $ The Hitachi is made in Malasyia, and looked cheap compared with the Makita, which is made in the USA.
worth $ neg $ If you think you are saving $40 getting the Hitachi, you are right, and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a Makita.
pretty $ neg $ It ain't cutting edge (no pun intended) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain't pretty.
smooth $ pos $ But it is smooth, it is powerful, it is affordable & it has a proven track record.
adjustment $ neg $ I built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
costs $ pos $ So for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models I've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & I like that.
router $ pos $ Hitachi's M12V is a big beast of a router.
weight $ neg $ It's not the heaviest around (I think Porter-Cable has that distinction), but I found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation.
M12V $ pos $ In my table the M12V has been a real champ.
heavy $ pos $ The heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything I threw at it.
controls $ neg $ With the PlungeLIFT all my bit changing has been done above the table, although I still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock (and, of course, the speed and ON/OFF controls).
motor $ pos $ Nice things about the M12V: - in a table, the powerful 3 1/4 HP motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - Amazon's price
weight $ neg $ Not so nice things: - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing (outside of a table) - the 1/4" chuck sleeve requires MUCH tightening to keep bits from slipping
router $ pos $ This is truly a Clydesdale among the industry 3HP+ router workhorses.
solidity $ pos $ Built like a tank, yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the Leigh dovetail jig.
start $ pos $ The soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation.
heavy $ neg $ It is a heavy but well-balanced machine, which is an asset when maximum stability is desired.
guide $ pos $ The edge guide is top quality, easy to install and accurate.
speed $ pos $ This was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit.
adjustment $ pos $ The height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
collet $ neg $ The only complaint I have is that the 1/4" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4" bits.
collet $ neg $ The Hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately.
machine $ pos $ This is a great deal, and I'm elated with my decision to go with Hitachi's green machine.
router $ pos $ Wish I could give it 4 1/2 stars.
adjustment $ pos $ I noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
speed $ pos $ The speed control is well designed and it works perfectly.
guide $ pos $ The included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well.
accessible $ pos $ The plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing.
heavy $ pos $ It is heavy enough to make it stable, but not too heavy to preclude hand use.
plunge $ neg $ The plunge action isn't smooth unless you make it so.
instructions $ neg $ The instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the RPMs of the speed settings were mentioned.
fit $ neg $ Also, the fit and finish could be better although this doesn't detract from performance.
price $ pos $ Overall this tool is very well worth the price and I have no regrets about my purchase.
money $ pos $ This is an excellent router for the money.
plunge $ neg $ The only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust.
springs $ neg $ I find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much.
money $ pos $ Other than that, i think it is the best router for the money.
router $ pos $ I must have gotten a good one.
adjustment $ pos $ I don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( I haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
Hitachi $ pos $ I would put the Hitachi up with the best!
vibration $ pos $ No vibration!
plunging $ pos $ Smooth plunging! ( it did stick a bit so I sprayed it w/ lubricant.
router $ pos $ It is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
shaft $ pos $ It is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great.
balance $ pos $ Very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models.
start $ pos $ The soft start is nice.
price $ pos $ The price is incredible with the bonus pack and Hitachi's $25 incentive ( you need the code ---go to Toolseeker.com and it tells you)
price $ pos $ The total price with delivery (free shipping ) was $135 !
cheap $ pos $ Less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer.
price $ pos $ Saw the Hitachi on Amazon.com with their $25.00 coupon (at the time) and could not resist trying it out.
operate $ pos $ UNLIKE other reviewers, I like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table.
switch $ pos $ Both the on/off switch (soft start) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand.
heavy $ pos $ It is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some Porter Cable models I tried.
spring $ neg $ 1. Your Hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism.
spring $ neg $ Mine was so bad I had to to use a hammer to free it (and this is why I'm giving it 4, not 5 stars).
sawdust $ neg $ I have noted that as you use the tool, sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention.
sawdust $ neg $ Not a killer problem, but not well done, either.
use $ pos $ For me, it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result.
price $ pos $ Can recommend the Hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on Amazon it is a bargain.
M12 $ pos $ After getting used to the M12 all the rest seemed lacking.
router $ pos $ On top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable, it is just a plunge router that works really well.
use $ pos $ I use it in the table (never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob), in my woodrat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances.
slop $ neg $ The only beef that I have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged.
big $ neg $ If it weren't so big I would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers..
router $ pos $ What an upgrade!!!
starts $ pos $ I have only used it with the 1/4" collet and a 1/2" round over bit, but I love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly.
adjustment $ pos $ The depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the M12V than it was on my old router.
use $ pos $ The handles make it very comfortable to use and I experience little vibration.
price $ pos $ Combine this with the excellent price we got in the Gold Box, and I'm really happy.
router $ pos $ I'm sure I don't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers, but I really like it!
router $ pos $ I first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot.
stable $ pos $ I find it very stable and comfortable to use, it doesn't jump around or make me feel like I need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control, and  it has very good visibility to see your cut.
fence $ pos $ It came with a good fence that  is simple yet precise and thats well made and won't break.
controls $ pos $ Also I like the  position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn't have any extra  knobs or gizmos.
simple $ pos $ I prefer things that are simple.
power $ pos $ The router has plenty  of power for any type of bit or wood I need to cut, and the speed control  knob is easy to get to.
guide $ neg $ I did have to cut off the ears  that hold the  template guide in place so I could get those big panel raising bits in it.
springs $ neg $ I also removed the springs in the plunge  tubes to make it easier to raise.
adjustments $ neg $ I added a crank for those times when I  need to make fine adjustments, but I seldom use it.
wrench $ neg $ I also put a bend in  the wrench so I can remove and install bits from the top of the table.
system $ pos $ Its  not a perfect system but its a very good one.
router $ pos $ I've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it.
quiet $ pos $ It is quiet and has plenty of power.
stability $ pos $ I find that it is stable in my hands and its' weight actually contributes to that stability.
plunging $ neg $ That said, I am disappointed in the plunging mechanism.
shafts $ neg $ Shortly after I brought it, the plunging shafts started sticking.
shafts $ neg $ After repeatly cleaning and recleaning, it still stuck after using it for a little while.
plunge $ neg $ I no longer use it as a plunge router, only as a stationary or table mounted router.
plunging $ neg $ If the plunging action isn't that important, then this is a great router.
plunging $ neg $ If the plunging action is critical to your work, look elsewhere.
performance $ pos $ I love the performance and features of this router.
money $ pos $ For the money, I'm not sure you can do better.
quiet $ pos $ It's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
plunging $ pos $ Smooth plunging mechanism.
fence $ pos $ The guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid.
grip $ neg $ It's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router, activate the chuck lock, and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up.
router $ pos $ Even with that, I highly recommend this router - outstanding performer.
router $ pos $ I purchased two of these beauties.
router $ pos $ I have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before I drop money on a tool and everyone I talked to loved this router.
router $ pos $ One cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem.
collets $ pos $ The design of the collets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craftman (toy/junk) routers I have previously purchased.
collets $ pos $ They were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything I have encountered.
money $ pos $ I have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than I would have if I had purchased a single cheap reliant shaper.
setup $ pos $ The setup works awesome, as with any tool I look closely at the individual tool for it's merits, and not just the company as a whole.
router $ pos $ I would however highly recommend the m12v router !
Hitachi M12V $ pos $ I'm not overly fond of GREEN but when I used this Hitachi M12V it turns out that now I'm very fond of it.
operation $ pos $ The smooth operation variable speed and a set of good Jasada Bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results.
router $ pos $ Its well made and user friendly.
router $ pos $ You'll love it!
router $ pos $ It is currently permanently mounted (3 years now) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot.
start $ pos $ This router has soft start and runs smooth and true.
router $ pos $ I use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems.
power $ pos $ It has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass, but I usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish.
price $ pos $ For the price, I am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup.
router $ pos $ You just can't go wrong with this one!
router $ pos $ Enjoy.
price $ pos $ This is an excellent router for the price.
router $ pos $ The first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use.
tool $ pos $ This is a well-made and powerful tool.
price $ neg $ I was some what sceptical when I seen the price deference between the other makers of comparible HP.
M12V $ pos $ The M12V has been great.
adjustment $ pos $ The height adjustment works well- not perfect.
bog $ pos $ The wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog.
quite $ pos $ What I really like about- its quite, it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that I can throw it away and buy another one without blinking.
router $ neg $ This router was a huge disapointment.
adjustment $ neg $ The depth adjustment was sloppy.
control $ neg $ The speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool (screwdriver or dowel rod) to effect any speed change.
control $ neg $ It was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers.
control $ neg $ My son tried it and he too couldn't change the speed without an assist.
heft $ pos $ I did like the heft of the machine.
stable $ neg $ It felt rather stable in my hands (heavy though.)
router $ neg $ I sent it back, as I think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective.
router $ neg $ All in all, not very good.
price $ neg $ I was skeptical about this router due to low price but have been totally impressed using it.
power $ pos $ The power is incredible, it cut through MDF and plywood like butter.
adjust $ pos $ The edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well.
adjustment $ neg $ The only not-so-positive comment I have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
price $ pos $ I do not count this as a negative, however, because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up!!!
router $ pos $ The ones I've kept (Porter Cables, Dewalts, Bosch, and this Hitachi) have proven their worth over the years, however, when I need a real workhorse, I grab this router.
machine $ pos $ I recently had to run a 3/4" straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn't even slow down.
router $ pos $ I could take 1/2" passes and it still didn't skip a beat.
Hitachi $ pos $ I've yet to find the limitation for this Hitachi (my only Hitachi tool, by the way) and quite frankly, I don't know that I have the muscle to push this machine any harder.
price $ pos $ Bottom line is that at $160, this is an absolute steal.
router $ pos $ I've got a buddy who's trying to offload his almost new $300 Speedmatic because he saw what this router can do.
router $ pos $ It is without even a slight doubt, my new favorite.
starts $ pos $ The Hitachi M12V is a dream to work with, smooth starts, adjustable speeds, micro-adjustable depth, and plenty of power to spare.
router $ pos $ I couldn't believe what I had been missing.
router $ pos $ If you're looking for a 3hp plunge router, the Hitachi M12V is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget.
router $ pos $ I'll be getting a second one for my router table!
power $ pos $ I have been impressed with the power of the Hitachi M12V.
bog $ pos $ It doesn't bog down under load.
Cuts $ pos $ Cuts are easy and smooth.
works $ pos $ I use it on a router table, and it is works well.
adjustment $ neg $ The major reasons I didn't give it a five are:  One, I didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
adjustment $ neg $ I replaced it with a Router Raizer and it works much better.
wrench $ neg $ Two, the single wrench just doesn't work well.
latch $ neg $ The sliding latch is does not stay in place.
router $ pos $ Other than this, I am very pleased with the router and would buy it again.
price $ pos $ I really liked the price...
control $ pos $ I like the speed control.
power $ pos $ It has plenty of power.
adustment knob $ neg $ The fine adustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table.
Router Razier $ neg $ Finally, I gave up and I purchased a Router Razier.
wrench $ neg $ I am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "sliding wrench" which comes on the router.
router $ pos $ All in all I am pleased with the router.
power $ pos $ The power, low noise operation, and speed control makes up for the problems I have experienced.
heavy $ neg $ It it is a bit heavy for hand held work, but any router this size will be.
control $ neg $ Recenly the variable speed control went out.
control $ neg $ It would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die.
plunge $ neg $ The only other problem with this router that I have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick, then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated.
router $ pos $ Overall it is a great value.
price $ pos $ For the price I don't think you can beat it.
tool $ pos $ This is a fantastic tool to use.
heavy $ neg $ Only problem is that is a bit heavy.
product $ pos $ This is a quality product, not to be confused with teh cheap junk that Hitachi gets manufactured in China.
last $ neg $ They last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start.
safety $ neg $ My first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful.
router $ pos $ When the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money.
safety $ neg $ Luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case, a finger.
depth $ neg $ Once a depth is locked, it will jump off a little while working.
depths $ neg $ You must keep double checking depths.
machine $ pos $ But, for the money it is a good machine.
duration $ neg $ Well, my second one is now beginning to hicup a bit after about 1 1/2 years.
control $ neg $ The electronic speed control is not doing it's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will.
router $ pos $ For the hobbiest, it's probably a nice buy.
equipment $ pos $ For the person that uses the equipment every day, pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit.
safety $ neg $ If this machine just stops on you, unplug it quickly and get out of the way!
Works $ pos $ Works great, no odor, and uses regular bags.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ So far (3 weeks), we've had no problems with the Diaper Champ at all.
diapers $ pos $ It contains the smell from our baby's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside.
odors $ pos $ I don't know if we'll run into trouble down the road with odors, but so far I have no complaints and I'm very happy not to have to buy those refills.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ The Diaper Champ is the best we found!
bags $ pos $ There are no specail bags to deal with or buy!
bag $ pos $ We use the cheap $1.99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around.
smelling $ neg $ Now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will!
diaper $ pos $ We empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it!
product $ pos $ It is far better than just a trash can or the Diaper Genie and it's fairly inexpensive as baby products go!
refills $ pos $ I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.
diaper wipes $ neg $ The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.
Diaper Champ $ neg $ In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.
odor $ neg $ My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor.
Diaper Genie $ pos $ If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ It's far better than all others on the market.
convenient $ pos $ it's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn't have CLUMSY and CONFUSING (not to mention expensive) refills.
use $ pos $ There is no odor and extremely easy to use.
garbage bags $ pos $ 1. It uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills.
product $ pos $ 3. It never smelled - at all.
container $ pos $ The container is hard to open, which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler, and you do have to flip the handle carefully (which has saved more than a few of her toys,too.) I don't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby.
size $ neg $ Even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast.
size $ neg $ It seemed as if we were empting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless.
product $ pos $ This is a MUST HAVE product for all new moms!
Diaper Genie $ neg $ The Diaper Genie needs it's own refill bags in order to work and that's just more money that you don't have to spend.
work $ pos $ This is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers.
item $ neg $ I find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can't tightly bundle it without a mess, the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is OUTSIDE of the diaper pail.
fit $ neg $ My main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag.
hole $ neg $ The hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as I am now using medium diapers (I have a 3 month old) and they're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact I make then and how un-soiled they are.
odors $ neg $ This pail doesn't really keep in odors anymore and we'll probably have to get a new one, but since you can use regular garbage bags (we actually use the bags we get our groceries in because they hang perfectly) its still probably a better deal than the genie.
fill $ pos $ It is much easier to fill and unload than the Diaper Genie, plus, why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the Dollar Store?
diaper $ pos $ It also holds a lot more diapers.
size $ pos $ look at the size of it!
odor $ neg $ I have noticed an odor (one the I expected!) when unloading the Diaper Champ but at least you don't smell anything every time you use it.
diaper $ pos $ I highly recommend this!
diaper genie $ neg $ For my first I had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ I have to say that I am very happy with it so far.
replacement $ pos $ I am happy with the fact that I can use any bag in there and dont' have to pay out the nose for replacements.
use $ pos $ It's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers.
Champ $ pos $ The bags attach inside the Champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle.
function $ neg $ But, sometimes, if the Champ is too full, the flip handle won't function.
diaper $ neg $ (I never know when the Champ is full as there is no way too tell.  Even though not particularly aesthetic, how about making the Champ clear and see-through?) So, I lift the lid and find a wad of diaper, which I must remove, usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full.
diaper pail $ pos $ I bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and I absolutely LOVE it!
use $ pos $ The diaper champ couldn't be easier to use.
refills $ pos $ And the biggest plus is that you don't have to buy any expensive refills.
odor $ pos $ And it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained, which the diaper genie never did!
diaper champ $ pos $ If you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained, than the diaper champ is the one for you!
ITEM $ pos $ THIS ITEM IS EXCEPTIONAL I like the ease of use and it held the odor in great.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ Diaper Champ is by far the best diaper pail!
holds $ pos $ It holds a lot of diapers, not to mention the odor!
use $ pos $ It's easy to use (just a flip of the lid, and the diaper is gone!).
empty $ pos $ It's also easy to empty out.
garbage bags $ pos $ And best of all, no wasting money on special refill bags---this takes ordinary garbage bags!
diaper pail $ pos $ Whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers, this is the truly the only diaper pail to get!
pail $ pos $ Even though I never ventured into the cloth land, I was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life!
Opening $ neg $ Opening the Champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- I pinched my thumb a few times before I got the hang of it.
refills $ pos $ Being a very economical person, I appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- I never did like the prospect of buying special Diaper Genie refills.
plunger $ neg $ As one other reviewer pointed out, it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "plunger" to get the diapers in the pail, even though upon inspection the bag doesn't really look full.
emptying $ pos $ But from my experience, by the time it gets to that point, the bag is really heavy, so I think this is kind of helpful- it's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying.
gift $ pos $ This is a really great buy, for yourself or as a shower gift.
Champ $ pos $ Go for the Champ.
product $ pos $ I love this product!
dispose $ pos $ With the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn, it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones.
trash bags $ pos $ Plus, the fact that it used regular trash bags is great.
refills $ pos $ No need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require!
product $ pos $ and we still LOVE it!
holds $ pos $ *holds a LOT of diapers--a full week of toddler diapers!
trash bags $ pos $ (we wrap them nice and tight) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags--cheap!
odor $ pos $ *holds the odor in nicely!
use $ pos $ (every now and then I spray down the inside of the pail with Lysol) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers OUT of the pail Every now and then odors do escape the pail, but that is rare--and it usually just means that we've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ We keep the Diaper Champ in our daughter's nursery and her room definitely does NOT smell like dirty diapers.
holds $ pos $ It holds quite a few diapers, and pops them in quickly and easily.
trash bags $ pos $ I use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags I already use in the kitchen for it -- no special "diaper" trash bags necessary.
opening $ neg $ The opening could be a little wider, I suppose, but I haven't really seen anything else that could be improved.
works $ pos $ It works with a minimum of fuss.
diaper champ $ pos $ The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into "what diaper smell" in less time than that.
purchases $ pos $ This is one of the best purchases we made.
product $ pos $ Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.
champ $ pos $ Update I knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!
champ $ pos $ There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ.
pail $ pos $ I love this pail!
smell $ pos $ No smell, easy to use with one hand free, and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are imposible to find!
diaper pail $ neg $ Solid food poop is VERY STINKY and this diaper pail doesn't really contain the smell.
diaper pail $ neg $ I still like it a lot and am not changing it for another, but it is sort of stinky.
diaper pail $ pos $ I think it's great.
diaper pail $ neg $ I just wished that it didn't fill up so fast!
diaper pail $ pos $ It definitely keeps the smell out.
odor $ neg $ But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner.
odor $ pos $ First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor.
odor $ neg $ But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.
diaper champ $ pos $ The diaper champ is the best!
Champ $ pos $ I have tried other pails, but none have compared positively to the Champ.
use $ pos $ 1) The champ is easy to use.
Champ $ pos $ With the Champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid.
dispose $ pos $ It was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers.
store bags $ pos $ 2) The Champ uses regular store bags.
Champ $ pos $ You do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the Champ.

noise $ pos $ even did while daughter sleep and no noise!
smell $ pos $ I use the scented bags and even if I don't no smell!
space $ pos $ This holds alot and does not take up alot of space.
top loader $ neg $ We found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader, there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used.
Diaper Champ $ neg $ We resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the Diaper Champ for wet diapers only.
diaper wipes $ neg $ We also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ But like I stated, its better then a trash can, but I'm not sure if its better then the Diaper Genie.
diapers $ pos $ It holds almost a week's worth of diapers, and you don't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work.
smell $ pos $ At first I had a problem with some smell, then I realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all!
Diaper Champ $ pos $ Personally, I am VERY pleased with the Diaper Champ.
operate $ pos $ It is mindless to operate.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ It doesn't stink, ever (like some have assumed since it doesn't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon).
clean $ pos $ And it is very easy to clean.
diaper $ pos $ I can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time, it is that simple.
diaper pail $ pos $ This is a great diaper pail.
use $ pos $ There is no odor and it is very easy to use.
refills $ pos $ (You can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby.) Also, we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills (like with the Diaper Genie).
diaper pail $ pos $ And it's the largest diaper pail I've seen without taking up more floor space.
Champ $ pos $ and we definitely prefer our Champ!
cost effective $ pos $ Not only is it much more cost effective (you can use regular trash bags rather than Refills at $5 a pop), it is easier to use and clean, and has a larger capacity.
unit $ neg $ it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full.
pluger $ neg $ The pluger gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess.
item $ neg $ I registered for this item because of the good reviews it got, however I was not impressed.
diapers $ neg $ For one thing, The diapers always get jammed in it.
product $ neg $ The product also leaves a faint smell in the room.  
Diaper Champ $ neg $ All in all, the Diaper Champ serves its purpose, but it does not live up to its good reviews.
diaper champ $ pos $ I got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags.
works $ pos $ It works great.
smell $ pos $ I can't smell anything (and believe me, this is quite something with my baby).
works $ pos $ I ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because I change him so often downstairs.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ We have been using our Diaper Champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it.
odors $ pos $ It sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all (and we live in the damp and humid South, where odors of all kinds are generally rife).
install $ pos $ It is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags, easy to clean, and most important, easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle.
wipes $ pos $ We have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck (we always wrap them in the dirty diaper).
open $ pos $ It is a bit difficult to get the unit open (the advice to take it slowly is sound), but now that our son is walking and exploring, I consider this a positive attribute!
use $ pos $ Update (March 2005): My son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now, but the Diaper Champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use, no problems with odors, and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby :-)
Diaper Champ $ pos $ I decided to go with the Diaper Champ rather than the more popular Diaper Genie, because I didn't like the idea of having to buy special bags.
costly $ neg $  Too costly and not efficient if you ask me!
PRODUCT $ pos $ THIS PRODUCT IS A LIFESAVER!!
ODOR $ pos $ I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ODOR PROBLEM!
odor $ pos $ No one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor.'
Diaper Champ $ pos $ In fact, people who have been present while I changed my almost 3 month old son's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once I dispose of the diaper in the Diaper Champ.
CLEAN $ neg $ 2. YOU STILL HAVE TO CLEAN THE THING!!
WORKS $ pos $ SIMPLE AND IT WORKS!
Diaper Champ $ neg $ Also, for those that complain that the Diaper Champ isn't as effective as time passes, keep the following in mind: AS BABIES GET OLDER, THEIR DIETS CHANGES (aka SOLID FOODS!) AND SO DOES THE SMELL OF THEIR DIAPERS!
product $ pos $ All in all, this product is definitely one I would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price.
diaper champ $ pos $ I love the diaper champ, it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn't cost an arm and a leg for refills.
pail $ neg $ The only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full.
pail $ neg $ I wash ours out with lysol each time I empty it, and that helps, but when its hot out- well, just be prepared.
ODEROUS $ neg $ That's when it went from Oderless, to ODEROUS!
semelled $ neg $ It still smelled.
smell $ neg $ Then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not.
bags $ pos $ Using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient.
height $ pos $ The height is a more convenient reach than others, where you have to hunch over.
stable $ pos $ Its stable, so a curious toddler can't easily tip it over.
open $ neg $ CONS - Difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as I was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor.
diapers $ neg $ Also, diapers tend to stay in the middle, causing the pail to get backed up.
Diapers $ neg $ Diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don't tightly wrap them first. 
product $ pos $ I wanted this product because i didn't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended.
open $ neg $ The only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment.
pull $ neg $ The way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight.
open $ neg $ I can't tell you how many times i've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it.
product $ pos $ This is a GREAT product!
Diapers $ neg $ I had never liked the idea of the Diaper Genie because of the refills.
works $ pos $ The Champ works great.

filp $ pos $ I also love that you can flip the device with one hand...
unit $ pos $ Excellent diaper disposal unit.
product $ pos $ I am soooo pleased with this product!!!
investment $ pos $ A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!
Diaper Champ $ pos $ Diaper Champ is great.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ So I can't tell you if Diaper Champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell, but it's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby!
Diaper Champ $ pos $ Friends told me that the Diaper Genie did not work very well, so bought the Diaper Champ based on on-line reviews and I have been happy with it.
works $ pos $ It works easily with one hand, which is important.

diaper champ $ neg $ Don't buy the diaper champ.
pail $ pos $ I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.

Champ $ pos $ Well the Champ has survived it's first year with our son and it is great!!
refills $ pos $ The thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome!
work $ pos $ We just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are sented and they are like $6.00 and they work great.
bags $ pos $ We just recently had to buy another roll of bags. SO $6.00 for a year of bags- can't beat that!!
change $ pos $ We lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems.
diaper pail $ pos $ This is really a nice diaper pail.
diaper pail $ pos $ I recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers.
diaper pail $ pos $ In fact, I liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old, that I bought one for our new baby's room.
diaper pail $ pos $ Wow - was that disappointing and we didn't even have it 6 months before it broke.
Diaper Champ $ pos $ I bought the Diaper Champ and have been very happy for the following reasons.
refills $ pos $ 1.  The Diaper Champ doesn't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find!
work $ pos $ We just use the Glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from Target and they work wonderfully.

change $ pos $ 3.  Bags are easy to change.
smell $ neg $ Yes, you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle, but then it is gone.
smells $ neg $ To eliminate any smells we simple stuck a Stick Up room deodorizer inside the lid.
Works $ pos $ Works great!!!!
price $ pos $ 5.  The price is right.
small $ pos $ I want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason.
camera $ pos $ I'm in high school, and this camera is perfect for what I use it for, carrying it around in my pocket so I can take pictures whenever I want to, of my friends and of funny things that happen.
memory $ neg $ The only thing I don't like is the small size (8 MEG) memory card that comes with it.
room $ neg $ I have to move pictures off of it every day so I have room for more pictures the next, and I don't have enough money to buy the 256 MEG card that I've had my eye on for a while.
memory $ neg $ A larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy.
pictures $ neg $ Other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as I'd like them,
camera $ pos $ I'd say that this camera is perfect.
compact $ pos $ OK, not quite everything...but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it.
size $ pos $ I bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it, or have already bought it--it's size.
small $ pos $ It is amazingly small, it's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera.
small $ pos $ it is so small that I am able to keep it in my pocket, and I don't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable.
covering $ pos $ There is also a small covering for the lens, so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched.
picture $ pos $ The picture quality surprised me, when I first saw this camera I saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good--but I was wrong!
picture $ pos $ The picture quality of this camera is outstanding (taking its' size and price into consideration).
battery $ neg $ First off, the battery.
battery $ neg $ This camera uses a lithium battery, I find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient; because what if you are on vacation, where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station--there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there.
battery $ neg $ Not only is it inconvenient, but also the battery life span is short.
batteries $ neg $ This isn't uncommon in cameras, though, just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries, you should be fine.
zoom $ neg $ Another problem I had with this camera was the zoom function.
zooms $ neg $ Such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in...wrong!
zoom $ neg $ The zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet.
start-up $ neg $ Even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little, resulting in a noisy start-up.
flash $ neg $ The flash is very weak.
macro $ neg $ The last problem I found with this camera was the macro function.
auto-focus $ neg $ The auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject.
work $ neg $ To make matters work, there is no manual override to overcome this problem.
focus $ pos $ The focus is great, though, if you are not taking a macro shot.
cameras $ neg $ it's not my first choice in cameras,
size $ pos $ I have come across many other beginner cameras that I prefer over this camera, but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size.
camera $ pos $ If you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times, then this is a great camera choice.
s100 $ pos $ after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace, I decided on the s100.
camera $ pos $ It has given me zero problems, and the more I use it, the better I become at taking advantage of its strengths.
small $ neg $ 1) It is perhaps too small. 
buttons $ neg $ I find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on.
size $ neg $ Its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge (not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips).
delay $ neg $ 2) The delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots. 
autofocus $ neg $ This is due to the unusually slow autofocus system.
resolution setting $ neg $ 3) The lack of an intermediate resolution setting, as other reviewers have suggested, is a problem, but that problem is meaningless with a larger CompactFlash memory card
hot $ neg $ 4) The camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away.
hot $ neg $ It is hot enough to be annoying.
small $ pos $ This wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer (with photo quality paper).
snapshots $ pos $ It will not replace your high-end 35mm SLR but it's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots.
camera $ pos $ This IS the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to:
pictures $ pos $ Take quick pictures with excelent resolution
wait $ pos $ Hate to wait between shots
Download $ pos $ Download it fast to your computer
bundled software $ pos $ Have a great and easy to use bundled software
size $ pos $ Travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
Battery $ pos $ FYI, Battery doesn't die if you don't use LCD
color and light $ pos $ The color and light I captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to Turkey (gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques) were far superior to anything I've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera.
camera $ pos $ I love this camera.
camera $ pos $ I don't believe this camera is still available. But if you can find one, you might like to get it.
smallest $ neg $ It's still one of the smallest 2MP digital cameras on the market, and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever.
purchase $ pos $ I am very pleased with my purchase.
camera $ pos $ I've been incredibly happy with this camera.
camera $ pos $ This camera is great if you're used to a high-end SLR.
snapshots $ pos $ It's overkill for simple snapshots, unless you've got way too much money to blow.
Exposure $ pos $ Exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments (I leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure, which goes a bit dark for my taste).
flash $ pos $ Slow-syncro flash, macro/infinity mode, etc.
zoom range $ neg $ The zoom range is a little narrow (35-70mm in 35mm film equivalent), but given that the camera is the same as my wallet, I can't think of any real complaint.
body $ pos $ The SS body is wonderful, feels high-quality.
body $ pos $ It's the same body as the popular ELP2 APS camera (take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you'll have an idea of the front profile!).
lcd $ neg $ I left the camera in my car in Maine (not a very hot place) and the LCD screen cracked !
design $ neg $ I then realized a major design flaw.
functionality $ neg $ All the camera's functionality is only available (or selectable) when the screen is functional.
screen $ neg $ When the screen stops working, you're out of luck !
manual mode $ pos $ I discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure, white balance, flash (red eye, person against bright background, flash on, flash off, flash automatic).
viewfinder $ neg $ The viewfinder does not accurately represent the pucture being taken.
zoom $ neg $ The digital zoom is crap.
fits $ pos $ It fits in your pocket.
panorama setting $ pos $ The panorama setting is unbelieveable !
pictures $ neg $ The pictures are a little dark sometimes.
flash $ pos $ You have the option to have the flash automatic or off.
S100 $ pos $ The new Canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the S100.
movie mode $ neg $ The movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160X120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640X480.
mode $ pos $ It has one more resolution of 1024X768 and a "Normal" compression mode.  And, it has the 3X zoom.
price $ neg $ The price is $... more.
software $ neg $ I originally gave this camera 5 stars. When I had Windows 98 it was wonderful but I got a new computer last November with XP the usb software is Sooo... not compatible with XP
drivers $ neg $ The new drivers on cannon's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software.
software $ neg $ The Adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with XP so you are forced to create your document then either print it from Windows or export it to another application.
pictures $ pos $ But it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2.1 MP camera.
camera $ pos $ I love this camera!
memory $ neg $  the only thing I don't like about it is that You have to buy a larger memory card, first thing!
price $ pos $ I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera $ pos $ I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
camera $ pos $ I got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon.
camera $ pos $ I would recommend this camera unequivocally!
battery $ pos $ But this DOES work even if you turn off the LCD viewing -- great  battery saver.
camera $ pos $ A great camera, but here are some points which I don't notice in most of the reviews here, which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer:
Elph s100 $ pos $ I purchased the Elph s100 mainly because I thought it was cool.
exposure $ pos $ The camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great (not as good as prints from my pro digital camera, but still VERY good).
smaller $ pos $ But I was ready to upgrade and when I discovered that Canon  was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher  resolution, I had to have the S100.
S100 $ pos $ This is my second digital camera, but I'm much more impressed with the Canon S100 Digital Elph than I EVER was with my Kodak DC240.
light $ pos $ This camera is so light and tiny that I literally carry it everywhere with me, which is great considering I'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting.
software $ pos $ The software that comes with the Digital Elph is very nice and intuitive.
software $ pos $ The PhotoStitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots.
on-camera controls $ neg $ My only complaint and the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren't as intuitive as they should be.
work $ neg $ I've often struggled to get something to work the way I want it, and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time!
camera $ pos $ Other than that, I love this camera.
pictures $ pos $ The pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect.
size $ pos $ The good:  Small size; durable-seeming metal case; easy to use; visually distinctive; good picture quality; fast USB connection; mostly intuitive operation; really cool PhotoStitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas.
size $ pos $ If compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera, the Canon PowerShot S100 Digital Elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design.
image quality $ pos $ The S100's image quality rates in the middle of its class, but it can still be a reasonable choice for students, families, or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack.
camera $ pos $ I purchased this camera before it went on sale, and while I wouldn't have minded keeping the extra $$$, it was definitely worth it.
product $ pos $ I have been absolutely, completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities.
product $ pos $ This is a great product, and Canon has done an excellent job.
jewel $ pos $ I received this little jewel as a gift and I can honestly say Iabsolutely love it.
usability $ pos $ I give this product five stars for its usability,performance, expandability, and definitely looks!
camera $ pos $ First, I have to say that I have NEVER had the slightest problem with this camera or the software.
software $ pos $ The software has been installed on Windows 95, 98, 2000 and XP and I haven't had any problems with it.
camera $ pos $ The camera is solid, performs well, takes good pictures, and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the LCD viewfinder.
pictures $ neg $ All that said, I am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera.
sharp $ pos $ They are razor sharp, the color balance is perfect, and the focus is great.
pictures of people $ neg $ When taking pictures of people, however, it shows EVERY flaw in the subject's skin.
pics $ neg $ Other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better.
processing $ neg $ I will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture.
camera $ pos $ I must say, I think this is the coolest camera I've ever  owned!
size $ pos $ First, it really is tiny; the size of a pack of cigarettes, maybe  a scooch deeper.
use $ pos $ Second, it is  incredibly easy to use.
photos $ pos $ I just went on a quick photo shoot in NYC's  Central Park today, and what a bunch of beautiful photos I took, if I do  say so myself (and I do!)
use $ pos $ The camera is as easy to use as a point and  shoot, and with instant review on the LCD screen, you can retake any  flubbed shots on the spot.
optical zoom $ pos $ The two-times optical zoom operates smoothly  and quietly, and lo and behold, a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically  slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off.
software $ pos $ I also had no  problems installing or running the camera software on my PC.
S100 $ pos $ At any rate, if you have been interested in  digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back,  consider the Canon S100 Digital Elph.
camera $ pos $ It really is the perfect travel  camera, plus it offers the convenience of digital photography.
use $ pos $ Really like it, easy to use, great images, very intuitive, fits in my jacket pocket.
compact $ pos $ I was looking for a compact, rugged (I carry it hiking, skiing, boating, etc) camera which is easy to use.

640x480 mode $ pos $ I have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode, while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera, its quality easily surpasses that of my old Hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe (max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card).

(digital zoom only though)...but still...(my old one can't do that...you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip.)
merge pictures $ pos $ photo stitch (merge pictures to create a panoramic one..even my old one can do this and it's really cool to have it now still)

camera $ pos $ i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures.

designed $ pos $ if you haven't noticed, they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer. 
made $ pos $ they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer.

low-light conditions $ neg $ Only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash.

button $ neg $ my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .

indoor picture $ neg $ 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .

picture $ neg $ 3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture . 
auto mode $ pos $ the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .

software $ pos $ the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable . 
print $ pos $ i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .

camera $ pos $ still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! 
camera $ pos $ this is a wonderful camera . 
4mp $ pos $ 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price . 
picture $ pos $ one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .

size $ pos $ it 's size also makes it ideal for travel . 
camera $ pos $ overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera . 
camera $ pos $ awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package . 
closeup mode $ pos $ the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc. 
camera $ pos $ in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images . 
affordability $ pos $ while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability . 
bang-for-the-buck $ neg $ it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there . 
size $ pos $ like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) . 
screen $ pos $ the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better . 
deal $ pos $ i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money . 
wma file $ pos $ another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it . 
software $ pos $ the software is great . 
software $ pos $ transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy . 
battery life $ pos $ even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good . 
accessory $ neg $ only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet . 
remote $ neg $ i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard . 
interface $ pos $ they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use . 
player $ pos $ get it , it 's woth every penny ! ! 
player $ pos $ i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it . 
software $ pos $ software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money ) 
price $ pos $ much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate 
headphone $ neg $ you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck 
sound $ pos $ the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s . 
navigation $ neg $ navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well . 
weight $ pos $ at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod . 
battery $ pos $ the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) . 
software $ pos $ so far the software for the pc works easily . 
looking $ pos $ by the way , it looks nice also . 
player $ pos $ it 's worth it . 
battery life $ pos $ my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both . 
sound $ neg $ the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones . 
control $ pos $ the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! 
scroll wheel $ pos $ the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad . 
size $ neg $ it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to . 
screen $ neg $ the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue . 
firewire $ neg $ it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves . 
leather pouch $ pos $ the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices . 
battery $ pos $ other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod . 
size $ pos $ overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! 
battery $ pos $ ( batteries last longer too ! ) 
player $ pos $ the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player . 
player $ pos $ i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever . 
menu $ pos $ the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen . 
screen $ pos $ the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long . 
player $ pos $ all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) . 
program $ pos $ it 's a very intuitive program . 
installation $ pos $ i had no problems following their installation instructions . 
menu $ pos $ the menus are very easy to navigate . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks . 
control $ pos $ the other controls are all very easy to use . 
play option $ pos $ it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist . 
playlist $ neg $ the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer . 
price $ pos $ it also costs a lot less than the ipod . 
earbud $ pos $ the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad . 
earbud $ pos $ they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality . 
deal $ pos $ this is a good deal for music and data storage . 
software $ neg $ the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software . 
software $ neg $ the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use . 
player $ neg $ the player itself has all sorts of problems . 
face plate $ neg $ the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so . 
file transfer $ neg $ the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset . 
scroll $ neg $ the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others . 
scroll $ neg $ depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive . 
scroll $ neg $ the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating . 
sound $ pos $ on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured . 
audio $ pos $ i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs . 
player $ neg $ overall , a very disappointing product . 
setup $ neg $ the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par . 
player $ neg $ the player 's mechanics are also flawed . 
player $ neg $ although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product . 
price $ pos $ when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat . 
scroll $ neg $ one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like . 
this thing $ pos $ other than that this thing is great ... 
battery $ pos $ zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod . 
battery $ pos $ the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance . 
earphone $ neg $ deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ). 
screen $ neg $ the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky . 
nomad $ pos $ i love my new nomad , its great ! 
price $ pos $ for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison . 
software $ pos $ the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds . 
case $ pos $ the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) . 
headphone $ neg $ on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof ! 
deal $ pos $ but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad . 
player $ pos $ best electronic i 've bought since i was born . 
set up $ pos $ so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos . 
nomad explorer $ pos $ just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc. 
player $ pos $ not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy . 
design $ pos $ very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has . 
leather case $ pos $ the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly . 
button $ pos $ all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand . 
sound quality $ pos $ the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with . 
sound option $ pos $ lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options . 
navigation $ pos $ navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch . 
navigation $ pos $ also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player . 
screen saver $ pos $ oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^ 
file limit $ pos $ another plus in my book , no file limits ! 
playlist $ pos $ i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up . 
storage $ pos $ i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder . 
player $ pos $ i really have no complaints over this unit . 
player $ pos $ i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player . 
installation $ neg $ getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience . 
manual $ neg $ also , the instruction manual is very bad . 
player $ pos $ i have no complaints with this mp3 player . 
file transfer $ pos $ getting files onto it is quick and painless . 
sorting $ pos $ then sorting the files is easy as pie . 
storage $ pos $ and it holds sooooo much music and audio files . 
player $ pos $ my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems . 
sound $ neg $ also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with . 
battery $ pos $ the battery is nice . 
screen $ pos $ the lcd screen was very large and readable . 
player $ pos $ compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck . 
zen $ pos $ i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class . 
transfer $ neg $ transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 . 
transfer $ neg $ it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling . 
size $ neg $ size - bigger than the ipod 
software $ neg $ software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut . 
sound quality $ pos $ sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features . 
player $ pos $ i love this player . 
player $ neg $ all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since . 
player $ pos $ i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again . 
software $ pos $ the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) . 
player $ pos $ anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it . 
size $ neg $ first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture . 
price $ pos $ way less expensive than the ipod . 
interface $ pos $ i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. . 
folder structure $ neg $ the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another . 
chinese name $ neg $ and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title .. 
transfer $ pos $ not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless . 
xtra $ pos $ bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent . 
storage $ pos $ i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it . 
interface $ pos $ both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice . 
transfer $ pos $ ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) . 
case $ pos $ people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection . 
case $ pos $ it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to . 
sound quality $ pos $ the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) . 
option $ pos $ you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) . 
button $ neg $ the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing . 
button $ neg $ my " fast forward " button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go . 
button $ pos $ all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well . 
support $ pos $ but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. . 
size $ neg $ sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much . 
size $ pos $ it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy . 
product $ pos $ bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price . 
id3 tag $ neg $ unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks . 
id3 tag $ neg $ if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders . 
player $ pos $ i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it . 
setup $ pos $ the setup and transfer process was cake for me . 
transfer $ neg $ i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem . 
explorer $ neg $ the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again . 
player $ neg $ the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well . 
player $ pos $ now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems . 
screen $ pos $ the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it . 
eax mode $ pos $ the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides . 
jog dial $ neg $ the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it . 
mp3 player $ pos $ all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player . 
nomad $ pos $ i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! 
installation $ neg $ i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver . 
software $ pos $ i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy . 
playlist $ pos $ ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier . 
mediasource $ pos $ i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer . 
playback quality $ pos $ being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable . 
sound $ pos $ when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! 
sound quality $ pos $ the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior . 
nomad $ pos $ actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated . 
finding $ pos $ finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy . 
screen $ pos $ the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight . 
use $ pos $ i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price . 
player $ pos $ just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date . 
size $ pos $ nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something . 
sound quality $ pos $ all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) . 
eax $ pos $ the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative . 
player $ neg $ i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment . 
control $ neg $ - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones . 
fly wheel $ neg $ the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use . 
button $ neg $ the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical 
software $ neg $ - included creative software is pretty poor . 
price $ pos $ - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price 
sound $ pos $ - best in class sound 
screen $ pos $ - large easy readable screen 
play $ neg $ i tried to play the song three times , with no success . 
play $ neg $ it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk . 
software $ neg $ had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches . 
player $ pos $ working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! ! 
player $ pos $ i love it ! ! 
player $ neg $ this product is too fragile for normal use . 
software $ pos $ i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred . 
software $ neg $ however , the creative software is not real intuitive . 
software $ neg $ the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest . 
rename $ neg $ if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly . 
transfer $ pos $ transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 . 
sound $ pos $ it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds . 
earbud $ pos $ i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players . 
storage $ pos $ i love the storage in this thing . 
warranty $ neg $ this is ridiculous . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection . 
interface $ neg $ the interface used could be better designed . 
interface $ neg $ it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want . 
case $ neg $ and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control . 
case $ neg $ it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it . 
control $ neg $ the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel . 
player $ pos $ despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. . 
lock up $ neg $ however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times . 
firmware $ neg $ quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time . 
warranty $ neg $ i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year " no questions asked " replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! 
player $ pos $ this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product . 
size $ neg $ 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more . 
scroll $ neg $ 2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select . 
sound quality $ pos $ first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod . 
software $ pos $ the player 's software is very easy to use and very good . 
software $ pos $ compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use . 
player $ pos $ to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod . 
player $ pos $ this thing seriously is a good player though . 
unit $ pos $ overall i like the unit . 
player $ neg $ i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) . 
price $ pos $ 1 ) price / gb of storage 
storage $ pos $ 2 ) storage capacity 
battery $ pos $ 3 ) user replaceable battery 
construction $ neg $ 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ) 
scroll $ neg $ 2 ) scroll button / switch 
case $ neg $ 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing . 
player $ pos $ overall i like it . 
storage $ pos $ the storage capacity is great . 
price $ pos $ the price compared to the ipod is great . 
price $ pos $ price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad . 
itunes $ neg $ but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes . 
scroll $ neg $ the scroll bar is a bit of a pain . 
software $ pos $ i 've had no problems with the software . 
software $ pos $ i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) . 
software $ pos $ this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem . 
software $ pos $ the software comes with plenty of defaults genres . 
sound $ pos $ the sound from the player is ok . 
sound $ neg $ i was a little disappointed in the low end . 
sound $ neg $ the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected . 
this thing $ pos $ this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records . 
storage $ pos $ one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) . 
price $ pos $ for the price and features it is really good . 
navigation $ neg $ in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders . 
navigation $ neg $ you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division . 
software $ neg $ the software , which comes with player is not good at all . 
nomad explorer $ neg $ i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work . 
software $ neg $ so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly . 
zen $ pos $ the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car . 
battery life $ pos $ longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities . 
player $ pos $ i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it . 
sound $ pos $ the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent . 
style $ pos $ the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to . 
player $ pos $ so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing . 
player $ neg $ this thing is trash . 
construction $ neg $ a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop 
screen $ neg $ b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display 
scroll $ neg $ c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said 
software $ neg $ d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on 
case $ neg $ e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage 
look $ neg $ f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course 
software $ neg $ the software failed repeatedly . 
customer support website $ neg $ creative labs customer support website is useless . 
software $ neg $ software downloads on the site crashed my pc . 
player $ pos $ i just bought this player today and i already love it . 
play $ neg $ it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd . 
scroll $ neg $ another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on . 
player $ pos $ otherwise , this player is awesome ! 
screen $ pos $ it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily . 
volume range $ pos $ the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want . 
player $ pos $ overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it . 
this item $ pos $ i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards . 
price $ pos $ naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable . 
value $ pos $ compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops . 
sound quality $ pos $ - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company . 
use $ pos $ - the unit is easy to use and intuitive . 
uploading $ pos $ - uploading music is quick and easy . 
software $ pos $ although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent . 
player $ pos $ - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't . 
scroll $ pos $ as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible . 
screen $ pos $ the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool . 
feature $ pos $ there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization . 
battery $ pos $ - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily . 
battery life $ pos $ also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy . 
equipment $ pos $ - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for . 
case $ neg $ the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) . 
headphone $ pos $ the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead . 
player $ pos $ this player is an ideal purchase . 
player $ neg $ the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt . 
player $ pos $ i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player . 
software $ neg $ on my main computer the software did not work right . 
customer support $ neg $ i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all . 
player $ pos $ i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic . 
player $ pos $ so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost . 
zx $ pos $ i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review . 
size $ pos $ it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx . 
sound quality $ pos $ the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so . 
lcd $ pos $ the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did . 
scroll wheel $ pos $ the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate . 
sound $ pos $ the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product . 
eax $ pos $ the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle . 
enviromental audio $ neg $ the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . ) 
signal to noise ratio $ pos $ the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods . 
software $ pos $ the software has n't been a hassle for me at all . 
price $ pos $ lastly , the price is fantastic : 
software $ pos $ i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems . 
usb 2.0 $ pos $ usb 2.0 - very fast 
earbud $ neg $ yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them . 
sound $ pos $ but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers . 
recharger $ pos $ and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ). 
look $ pos $ it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light . 
scroll $ pos $ the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it . 
player $ pos $ i am very pleased so far . 
use $ pos $ very simple to use . 
battery $ neg $ 1 ) a spare battery would have been great . 
game $ neg $ 2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it . 
work $ neg $ 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players 
use $ pos $ all in all suprisingly easy to use . 
sound quality $ pos $ lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy . 
sound $ pos $ excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox . 
transfer $ pos $ transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad . 
transfer $ pos $ i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer . 
storage $ pos $ huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing . 
transfer $ pos $ having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers . 
navigation $ neg $ navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs . 
fm receiver $ neg $ fm receiver - it has none . 
construction $ neg $ cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners . 
feel $ neg $ the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive . 
feel $ neg $ as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable . 
play $ neg $ the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd . 
software $ neg $ software - the software is crap . 
rip cd $ pos $ i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of . 
software $ neg $ otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward . 
instruction $ neg $ even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out . 
line out jack $ neg $ no line out jack - as i said , there is none . 
line out jack $ neg $ it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack . 
control $ neg $ controls are a bit awkward . 
control $ neg $ it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman . 
headphone $ neg $ crappy headphones . 
earbud $ neg $ the included earbuds were uncomfortable . 
navigation $ neg $ difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate . 
navigation $ neg $ it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly . 
navigation $ neg $ i think this is it 's biggest flaw . 
control $ neg $ up , down , left , and right would have given me better control . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get " stuck " rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it . 
case $ neg $ it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack . 
case $ neg $ as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand . 
player $ pos $ overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it . 
sound $ neg $ i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement . 
price $ pos $ for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price . 
button $ pos $ the buttons and interface are very easy to use . 
click buttons $ pos $ simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use . 
software $ neg $ but the major problem i had was with the software . 
instruction $ neg $ the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple . 
sync $ neg $ the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful . 
transfer $ neg $ i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused . 
mp3 player $ pos $ with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod . 
interface $ pos $ i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer . 
product $ pos $ i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product . 
software $ pos $ the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine . 
headphone $ neg $ the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity . 
battery life $ pos $ the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs . 
navigation $ pos $ took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo . 
player $ pos $ i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box . 
product $ pos $ all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product . 
size $ pos $ it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well . 
product $ pos $ i would recommend this product to anyone . 
player $ pos $ before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there . 
software $ pos $ many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me . 
cd rip $ pos $ the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive . 
software $ pos $ the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple . 
control $ pos $ the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual . 
player $ pos $ the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium . 
battery $ pos $ the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files . 
playlist $ pos $ playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists . 
software $ pos $ the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 . 
player $ pos $ it is an extremely cool gizmo . 
navigation $ neg $ the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving . 
playlist $ neg $ creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked . 
sound quality $ neg $ my only significant complaint is sound quality . 
eax $ neg $ the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq . 
sound quality $ neg $ i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with " bass boost . " 
product $ pos $ well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket . 
product $ pos $ well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) . 
program $ neg $ well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze . 
price $ pos $ not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have . 
battery life $ pos $ it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ). 
id3 tag $ neg $ my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them . 
transfer $ pos $ oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy . 
weight $ neg $ a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine . 
scroll wheel $ pos $ it 's easy . 
button $ pos $ the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate . 
backlight $ pos $ the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see . 
eax $ pos $ my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature . 
eax $ pos $ its really cool . 
sound quality $ pos $ sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) . 
song speed $ pos $ you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too . 
earbud $ neg $ but the earbuds suck ! 
case $ neg $ i forgot , the case does n't fit . 
case $ neg $ my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great . 
storage $ pos $ also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy . 
player hardware $ pos $ first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. . 
sound $ neg $ the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. . 
software $ neg $ what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software . 
bookmark $ neg $ bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. . 
bookmakr $ neg $ rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . . 
bookmark $ neg $ this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. . 
playlist $ neg $ the dynamic playlists ( " now playing " , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. . 
price $ pos $ while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player . 
nomad $ pos $ i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it . 
weight $ neg $ it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life . 
storage capacity $ pos $ the storage capacity is great for me -- 
control $ neg $ the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price . 
load $ neg $ loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well . 
tag $ neg $ my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software . 
tag $ neg $ other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system . 
software $ neg $ also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore " the " when it lists the cds in alphabetical order . 
playlist $ neg $ finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order . 
product $ pos $ the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product . 
software $ pos $ a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes . 
sync $ pos $ first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer . 
shuttle $ pos $ the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) . 
sync $ pos $ second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer . 
player $ pos $ the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player . 
software $ pos $ third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer . 
cd burner $ neg $ only thing missing from creative is a cd burner . 
creative $ pos $ for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages . 
scroll $ pos $ zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player . 
remove $ pos $ it also lets you remove songs from the play order . 
delete $ pos $ if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order . 
zen $ pos $ its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus. 
this thing $ pos $ i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since . 
control $ neg $ the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as " sexy " looking . 
software $ pos $ the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered . 
headphone $ neg $ as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! 
the unit $ pos $ the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! 
unit $ pos $ overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it . 
size $ pos $ this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size . 
case $ pos $ it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly . 
cover $ neg $ the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid . 
software $ pos $ extremely convenient . 
price $ pos $ great price . 
software $ pos $ i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all . 
scroll $ neg $ the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal . 
size $ neg $ it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it . 
player $ pos $ i 'm really happy with this purchase . 
size $ neg $ i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size . 
screen $ pos $ now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here . 
size $ neg $ there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall . 
case $ pos $ but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything . 
price $ pos $ ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion . 
weight $ neg $ its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket . 
playlist $ neg $ its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) . 
battery life $ neg $ it also has unproven battery life . 
software $ neg $ finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best . 
price $ pos $ * price and capacity 
design $ pos $ * slick-looking design and improved interface 
battery $ pos $ * removable battery 
case $ neg $ * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window . 
scroll $ neg $ * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models . 
eax $ neg $ * eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files . 
volume $ neg $ * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ). 
software $ neg $ * software is absolutely terrible : 
transfer $ neg $ -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ). 
recognition $ neg $ -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library . 
change $ neg $ -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks . 
software $ neg $ -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best . 
player $ neg $ a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be . 
size $ pos $ despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! 
cd rip $ pos $ i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me . 
transfter $ pos $ file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 . 
software $ neg $ my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the " year " field . 
sound $ pos $ to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player . 
eax $ pos $ the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train . 
navigation $ neg $ navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it . 
player $ pos $ at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria . 
this $ pos $ i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift . 
use $ pos $ i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful . 
memory $ pos $ the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun . 
battery $ pos $ plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad . 
software $ neg $ the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with . 
rip $ pos $ ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good . 
player $ pos $ considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player . 
sound quality $ pos $ it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market . 
zen xtra $ pos $ after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed . 
battery $ pos $ first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod . 
battery $ pos $ it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted . 
software $ pos $ the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use . 
playlist $ pos $ you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player . 
transfer $ pos $ and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy . 
sound $ pos $ the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise . 
earbud $ pos $ i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well . 
earbud $ pos $ they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department . 
equalizer $ pos $ i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too . 
clip $ neg $ however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off . 
case $ neg $ also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display . 
player $ neg $ this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues . 
storage $ pos $ 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more . 
stoppage $ pos $ the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click . 
software $ neg $ 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? 
mediasource $ neg $ mediasource did not recognize my tags ! 
eax $ neg $ 2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax . 
eax $ neg $ creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static . 
mediasource $ neg $ 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws . 
folder structure $ neg $ 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) . 
storage $ neg $ in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) . 
stop button $ neg $ 5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! 
manual $ neg $ but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version . 
usb recharge $ neg $ 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice . 
mediasource $ neg $ 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook . 
notmad $ pos $ m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! 
software $ pos $ given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software . 
player $ pos $ now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! 
memory $ pos $ i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory . 
sound quality $ pos $ the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! 
navigation $ pos $ it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device . 
operate $ pos $ i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive . 
software $ neg $ the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated . 
napster $ pos $ one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software . 
name $ neg $ they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) . 
player $ neg $ i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason . 
storage $ pos $ + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering . 
musicmatch software $ pos $ + i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit 
screen $ pos $ + screen was good , easy to read 
sound quality $ pos $ + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great . 
software $ neg $ - the software that came with it was tough to load . 
battery top $ neg $ - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch . 
top $ neg $ the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective ) 
cover $ neg $ - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well 
flywheel $ neg $ - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage . 
construction $ neg $ - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last . 
zen xtra $ pos $ i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed . 
player $ pos $ the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality . 
navigation $ pos $ navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too . 
software $ pos $ many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective . 
player $ pos $ i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision . 
construction $ neg $ the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player . 
construction $ neg $ i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for . 
price $ pos $ the price / performance looked just right . 
headphone jack $ neg $ i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose . 
construction $ neg $ i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy . 
installation $ neg $ like other reviewers , installation was hell . 
software $ neg $ about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc . 
online help $ neg $ after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all . 
player $ neg $ in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered . 
installation $ neg $ to my amazement , even that process was error-prone . 
things $ neg $ it took several days of attempts before things finally " worked " again and i have n't a clue why . 
notmad software $ pos $ i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement . 
nomad $ neg $ my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) . 
creative product $ neg $ i will never buy a creative product again . 
thing $ neg $ i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing . 
sound $ pos $ 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers . 
volume $ pos $ with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) . 
player $ pos $ the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers . 
user interface $ pos $ 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection . 
nomad explorer $ pos $ 3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player . 
nomad explorer $ pos $ the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad . 
usb 2.0 $ pos $ 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ). 
battery $ pos $ 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace . 
battery life $ pos $ 6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's . 
look $ pos $ 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate . 
player $ pos $ i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine . 
mediasource $ pos $ 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ). 
id3 tag $ pos $ i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags . 
cd rip $ pos $ b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive . 
sync $ pos $ c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer . 
wake up $ pos $ 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time . 
play mode $ pos $ 10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter . 
pause $ pos $ 11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player 
storage $ pos $ 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! 
plug and play $ neg $ 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it . 
id3 $ neg $ 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information . 
folder $ neg $ 3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files . 
fm $ neg $ 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras . 
accessory $ neg $ 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing . 
case $ neg $ 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed . 
flip switch $ pos $ 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch . 
sound $ pos $ great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes 
plug and play $ neg $ not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording 
storage $ pos $ can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go . 
wake up $ pos $ also love waking up to music with attached speakers . 
headphone jack $ neg $ so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out . 
creative $ neg $ nothing but hassle with this company . 
shuffle $ pos $ i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com. 
battery $ pos $ replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 . 
cover $ neg $ the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck . 
weight $ neg $ it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman . 
headphone $ neg $ headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature . 
software $ neg $ the software sucks . 
feature $ neg $ also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate . 
headphone jack $ neg $ i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up . 
size $ neg $ kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that . 
software $ neg $ software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad . 
player $ neg $ i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive . 
player $ neg $ i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work . 
product $ pos $ i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood . 
durability $ neg $ i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero . 
hard drive $ neg $ always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped . 
player $ neg $ i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the " rigor " of a business traveler . 
player $ pos $ the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market . 
software $ pos $ fact is , it could n't be easier to use . 
sound quality $ pos $ sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products . 
sound $ pos $ even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback . 
menu $ pos $ the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily . 
battery $ pos $ the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter . 
player $ pos $ connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! 
usb 2.0 $ pos $ usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast . 
folder $ neg $ minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable . 
folder $ neg $ the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name . 
id3 tag $ neg $ 2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called " unknown . " 
nomad explorer $ neg $ 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software . 
nomad explorer $ neg $ in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % . 
player $ pos $ my first impression was positive . 
eax $ neg $ first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes . 
menue $ neg $ second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed . 
scroll $ neg $ the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well . 
button $ neg $ the general button placement is not very user friendly . 
case $ neg $ third , the poor design continues with the case . 
price $ pos $ overall , a good buy for the price . 
navigation $ pos $ easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton . 
battery life $ neg $ my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of . 
battery $ neg $ there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! 
lock up $ neg $ i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times . 
construction $ neg $ the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case . 
case $ neg $ at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice . 
storage $ pos $ pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery 
battery life $ neg $ battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive 
construction $ neg $ creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack . 
build $ neg $ what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off . 
support $ neg $ feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products . 
scroll wheel $ neg $ the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device . 
software $ neg $ the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers . 
headphone jack $ neg $ enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem . 
folder $ neg $ the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that " creates " folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best . 
sound quality $ pos $ reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive . 
price $ pos $ sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod . 
quality $ neg $ but with a low price , comes lower quality . 
sound quality $ pos $ our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price . 
player $ neg $ the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap . 
headphone jack $ neg $ i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out . 
player $ pos $ i bought the player this week and i like it by far . 
battery $ pos $ removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years . 
value $ pos $ value : comparing data storage with price . 
appearance $ pos $ the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) . 
size $ pos $ the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . ) 
use $ pos $ easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this 
mediasource $ neg $ the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) . 
software $ neg $ in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place . 
size $ neg $ in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software 
display $ pos $ the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly 
storage $ pos $ huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you . 
sound $ pos $ the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack . 
eax $ pos $ with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it . 
software $ pos $ if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs . 
software $ pos $ i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome . 
battery $ pos $ battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours . 
player $ pos $ when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off . 
manage $ pos $ you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed . 
interface $ pos $ you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical . 
alarm $ pos $ there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good . 
clock $ pos $ there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful . 
firmware $ pos $ the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any . 
music $ pos $ the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption . 
battery life $ neg $ the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life . 
panel $ neg $ the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said . 
transfer $ neg $ you need the software to actually transfer files 
player $ neg $ the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings . 
lock up $ neg $ also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying . 
price $ pos $ and also , it 's priced very affordably . 
storage $ pos $ with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more . 
software $ pos $ the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted . 
sound $ neg $ the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones . 
sound setting $ pos $ sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference . 
accessing file $ pos $ accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive . 
battery $ pos $ possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery . 
battery $ pos $ since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) . 
value $ pos $ try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface . 
color $ pos $ i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy . 
player $ pos $ i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it . 
price $ pos $ price ! 
sound quality $ pos $ sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization . 
earphone $ neg $ yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway . 
interface $ pos $ i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough . 
playlist $ pos $ i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! 
software $ neg $ creative software stinks . 
cover $ neg $ the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day . 
player $ pos $ have had the player since xmass and love it ! 
sound $ pos $ great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price . 
warranty $ neg $ short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel . 
player $ pos $ this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod . 
price $ pos $ for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some . 
size $ pos $ the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods . 
build $ pos $ it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it . 
control $ pos $ i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least . 
scroll wheel $ pos $ the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there . 
screen $ pos $ the screen 's large and easily read . 
pop-up face $ neg $ the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect . 
sound $ pos $ sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod . 
interface $ pos $ interface - practically seamless . 
id3 tag $ pos $ yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy . 
playlist $ pos $ playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options . 
balance $ neg $ the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance . 
mediasource $ pos $ as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better . 
mediasource $ pos $ it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files . 
id3 tag $ pos $ the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well . 
software $ pos $ it was no problem for me to use their software . 
player $ pos $ overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too . 
equipment $ pos $ please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod . 
player $ neg $ do n't buy this player . 
player $ neg $ unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is " player either not connected or busy . " 
player $ neg $ do n't buy this player . 
product $ neg $ do not buy this product -- 
player $ neg $ i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended . 
software $ neg $ the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb . 
player $ pos $ honestly , i love this player . 
sound $ neg $ once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life . 
hard drive $ neg $ however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once . 
break $ pos $ because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible . 
player $ neg $ what a junk . 
freeze $ neg $ every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes . 
sound quality $ pos $ the sound quality is very good . 
control $ neg $ the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this . 
storage $ pos $ having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific . 
headphone jack $ neg $ typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others . 
design $ neg $ i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use . 
headphone jack $ neg $ the headphone jack seems to be a major problem . 
front cover $ neg $ the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily . 
headphone jack $ neg $ the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire . 
lock up $ neg $ the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now . 
hard drive $ neg $ in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class . 
canon powershot g3 $ pos $ i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase . 
use $ pos $ the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group . 
picture $ pos $ they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) . 
picture quality $ pos $ a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality . 
picture quality $ pos $ i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) . 
camera $ pos $ bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices . 
picture quality $ pos $ i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like . 
camera $ pos $ this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! 
picture $ pos $ just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance . 
use $ pos $ whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together . 
dial $ neg $ * main dial is not backlit . 
viewfinder $ neg $ * lens visible in optical viewfinder . 
camera $ pos $ overall i 'm happy with my toy . 
camera $ pos $ in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera . 
speed $ pos $ i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers . 
auto setting $ pos $ with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .

canon g3 $ pos $ i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied . 
photo quality $ pos $ i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality . 
feature $ pos $ the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds . 
viewfinder $ neg $ the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me . 
camera $ pos $ despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography . 
camera $ pos $ i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful . 
photo quality $ pos $ the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features . 
darn diopter adjustment dial $ neg $ the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . ) 
exposure control $ pos $ 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings . 
metering option $ pos $ excellent range of metering options as well . 
spot metering $ pos $ it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen . 
4mp $ pos $ 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer ) 
zoom $ pos $ 3 ) 4x zoom is nice 
focus $ pos $ 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible . 
focus $ pos $ you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus . 
size $ neg $ 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line ) 
design $ neg $ 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens ) 
viewfinder $ neg $ 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying . 
feature $ pos $ the camera has a wonderful set of features . 
lcd $ pos $ the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .

picture $ pos $ the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect . 
picture $ pos $ i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased . 
software $ pos $ the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use . 
lens cap $ neg $ the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) . 
menu $ pos $ the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use . 
camera $ pos $ it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price . 
camera $ pos $ recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available . 
control $ pos $ advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable . 
auto setting $ pos $ newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box . 
photo quality $ pos $ 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome . 
use $ pos $ those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use . 
zoom $ pos $ the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class . 
camera $ pos $ i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! 
picture $ pos $ it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing . 
photo quality $ pos $ i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode . 
canera $ pos $ this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get . 
print $ pos $ the prints are beautiful ! 
battery $ pos $ although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon . 
camera $ pos $ this is a great camera for you ! 
control $ pos $ the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use . 
control $ pos $ i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus . 
photo $ pos $ i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers . 
control $ pos $ but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! 
dial $ pos $ with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality . 
manual mode $ pos $ the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options . 
feel $ pos $ this camera also has a great feel and weight to it . 
feel $ pos $ you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy . 
camera $ pos $ the more i work with it , the more i love it ! 
camera $ pos $ i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! 
camera $ pos $ this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it . 
camera $ pos $ seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want . 
picture $ pos $ but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! 
four megapixel $ pos $ four megapixels is great . 
product $ pos $ it is a very amazing product . 
camera $ pos $ i highly recommend it . 
feature $ pos $ just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has . 
photo $ pos $ takes excellent photos . 
night mode $ pos $ night mode is clear as day . 
use $ pos $ i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it . 
viewfinder $ neg $ the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens . 
camera $ pos $ overall it is the best camera on the market . 
picture quality $ pos $ a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) ) 
lens cover $ neg $ b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage . 
zooming lever $ neg $ the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy . 
camera $ pos $ i love this camera . 
picture $ pos $ took hundreds of pictures and they were great . 
color $ pos $ great colors , pictures and white balance . 
optical zoom $ pos $ has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range . 
picture $ neg $ maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing . 
price $ neg $ it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got . 
camera $ neg $ sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task . 
camera $ neg $ i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust . 
grain $ neg $ the grain was terrible . 
flash photo $ neg $ well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise . 
photo $ pos $ when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome . 
camera $ pos $ the camera was a marvel . 
camera $ pos $ it is versatile and seems to be one of the best . 
g3 $ pos $ i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images . 
lag time $ neg $ the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash . 
depth $ pos $ what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 . 
flash $ neg $ relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots . 
external flash hot shoe $ pos $ fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 . 
flash $ pos $ contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon . 
software $ neg $ now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! 
software $ neg $ the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera . 
g3 $ pos $ what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware . 
color $ pos $ without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! 
g3 $ neg $ the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software . 
software $ neg $ what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical . 
image $ pos $ but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera . 
raw image $ pos $ i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits . 
camera $ pos $ i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision . 
camera $ pos $ this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well . 
battery life $ pos $ battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves . 
manual function $ pos $ manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding . 
viewfinder $ neg $ not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp . 
service $ pos $ the service from the supplier was exceptional . 
photo $ pos $ having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos . 
photo $ pos $ by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced . 
automode $ pos $ the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes . 
viewfinder $ neg $ about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder . 
camera $ pos $ i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! 
canon $ pos $ but canon never fails to amaze . 
raw format $ pos $ 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility . 
battery life $ pos $ 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons . 
software $ pos $ 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing . 
shape $ pos $ 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking . 
light auto correction $ pos $ the light auto-correction is awesome . 
picture $ pos $ you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right . 
white offset $ pos $ 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets . 
g3 $ pos $ overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view . 
camera $ pos $ this is quite simply the best you can ask for . 
low light focus $ neg $ the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds . 
picture $ neg $ got way too many blurry pictures . 
photo $ pos $ 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! ) 
camera $ pos $ the powershot g3 is a great camera . 
photo $ pos $ because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! 
camera $ pos $ 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera . 
feature $ pos $ it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features . 
unresponsiveness $ neg $ the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots . 
delay $ neg $ it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button . 
delay $ neg $ canon 's g3 does it consistently . 
focus $ neg $ it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot . 
g3 $ neg $ unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted . 
camera $ pos $ this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier . 
picture quality $ pos $ i love the quality of the pictures . 
picture quality $ pos $ they look fantastic . 
4mp camera $ pos $ the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there . 
picture $ pos $ with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots . 
control $ pos $ i love the eos based controls and easy menus . 
lens cap $ neg $ 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera . 
body $ neg $ 2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic . 
casing $ neg $ it had a heavier and more sturdy casing . 
performance $ pos $ i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! 
camera $ pos $ this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! 
battery life $ pos $ another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! 
camera $ pos $ am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! 
camera $ pos $ i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy . 
menu $ pos $ very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera . 
battery $ pos $ the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging . 
optical zoom $ pos $ the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom . 
viewfinder $ neg $ one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all . 
camera $ pos $ the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use . 
camera $ pos $ because this camera is beautiful . 
look $ pos $ the g3 looks like a work of art ! 
finish $ pos $ its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen . 
camera $ pos $ i am very pleased with it so far . 
viewfinder $ neg $ you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder . 
tiff format $ neg $ ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format . 
lag $ neg $ it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? 
import $ pos $ it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop . 
camera $ pos $ i am quite happy with the camera . 
manual $ pos $ it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep . 
camera $ pos $ yes , i recommend it over the competition . 
camera $ pos $ best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything . 
stitch picture $ pos $ this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website . 
picture $ pos $ first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's . 
camera $ pos $ this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time . 
camera $ pos $ however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice . 
design $ pos $ it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! 
display $ pos $ also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage . 
compactflash $ neg $ one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough . 
noise $ pos $ another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen . 
camera $ pos $ i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything . 
camera $ pos $ it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera .. 
use $ pos $ in general it is easy to use and well laid out . 
use $ pos $ it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly . 
feature $ pos $ the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography . 
auto mode $ pos $ in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode . 
memory card $ neg $ the included memory card is too small . 
made $ neg $ it is made of plastic . 
lens $ neg $ the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot . 
size $ neg $ while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets . 
lever $ neg $ the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile . 
flash $ neg $ flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost . 
strap $ neg $ the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to . 
camera $ pos $ the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing . 
option $ pos $ canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out . 
learning $ pos $ learning how to use it will not take very long . 
image quality $ pos $ the image quality is excellent . 
function $ pos $ range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography . 
camera $ pos $ this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used . 
macro $ pos $ the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot . 
camera $ pos $ this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel . 
4mp resolution $ pos $ i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; 
distortion $ neg $ yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture . 
shot $ pos $ in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! 
picture $ pos $ the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to . 
picture quality $ pos $ i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind . 
camera $ pos $ the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood . 
picture $ pos $ it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid . 
viewfinder $ neg $ to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder . 
design $ neg $ this camera has a major design flaw . 
viewfinder $ neg $ when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens . 
camera $ pos $ everything else about the camera is great . 
camera $ pos $ if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera . 
camera $ pos $ and so far , i 've been very pleased . 
lens $ pos $ the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer . 
lcd $ pos $ the moveable lcd screen is great . 
remote $ pos $ the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures . 
hot shoe flash $ pos $ the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit : 
battery $ pos $ i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse : 
battery charging system $ pos $ the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery . 
manual $ pos $ i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear . 
highlight $ neg $ i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better . 
no-off button $ neg $ the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera . 
body $ neg $ and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 . 
download $ pos $ i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files . 
camera $ pos $ i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it . 
camera $ pos $ very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price . 
g3 $ pos $ i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised . 
camera $ pos $ all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market . 
optic $ pos $ canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better . 
digital camera $ pos $ simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point . 
battery life $ pos $ the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen . 
look $ neg $ the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots . 
camera $ pos $ even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 . 
camera $ pos $ definetely a great camera . 
quality $ pos $ proven canon built quality and lens . 
feel $ pos $ feels solid in hand . 
weight $ neg $ rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros . 
i/p button $ pos $ im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! 
dvd player $ pos $ but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! 
dvd player $ pos $ it practically plays almost everything you give it . 
player $ neg $ i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor . 
price $ pos $ for the price it is a well spent investment ! 
dvd player $ pos $ this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways . 
look $ pos $ it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set . 
forward $ pos $ its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had . 
video format $ pos $ it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well . 
price $ pos $ and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? 
play $ neg $ what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) . 
dvd-r $ neg $ it sure does ! 
dvd-r $ neg $ that 's a rare and valuable feature . 
audio output $ pos $ another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying . 
forward $ pos $ at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! 
remote control $ neg $ weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] . 
finish $ pos $ update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! 
play $ neg $ many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player . 
dual-layer dvd $ neg $ player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 . 
player $ pos $ player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play . 
player $ neg $ i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse . 
apex $ neg $ will never purchase apex again . 
customer service $ neg $ customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them . 
case $ pos $ for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised . 
dvd $ neg $ then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all . 
cd $ neg $ new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays . 
player $ neg $ i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media . 
player $ neg $ this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it . 
support $ neg $ apex does n't answer the phone . 
customer service $ neg $ no way to contact their customer service . 
quality $ neg $ very bad quality . 
player $ pos $ i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites . 
player $ pos $ i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .

apex $ pos $ my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .

player $ neg $ unfortunately it turns out to be the " disposable " type . 
player $ neg $ have had problems since the first day 
play $ neg $ - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it . 
apex $ pos $ the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me . 
player $ pos $ i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it . 
heat $ neg $ it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation . 
smell $ neg $ it did also seem to have a strong " new electronics " smell for some time . 
freezing $ neg $ the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with " canned air . " 
player $ pos $ ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . ) 
jpeg slideshow $ pos $ the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting . 
remote $ neg $ the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons . 
button $ neg $ i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed . 
zoom mode $ neg $ i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode . 
zoom $ neg $ the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings . 
onscreen display $ neg $ having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying . 
player $ pos $ while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it . 
picture $ neg $ it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do . 
player $ neg $ i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job . 
customer service $ neg $ i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked . 
play $ neg $ wo n't play a lot of discs . 
play $ neg $ some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today . 
play $ neg $ it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten . 
tech support $ neg $ tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent . 
player $ neg $ i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! 
dvd player $ neg $ it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working . 
dvd player $ neg $ the dvd player does not work properly . 
player $ neg $ the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd . 
player $ neg $ this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before . 
customer support $ neg $ after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support . 
player $ pos $ nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have . 
play $ neg $ unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd . 
dvd $ neg $ on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .

jpeg $ pos $ even viewed cds full of jpgs . 
picture $ neg $ but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture . 
apex $ neg $ i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone . 
player $ neg $ who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will . 
remote $ neg $ we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work " apex " dvd players and none worked . 
dvd $ neg $ ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones ! 
remote $ neg $ i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective . 
customer service $ neg $ the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line . 
apex $ neg $ i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again . 
door $ neg $ door broke after a month . 
unit $ neg $ unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs . 
player $ neg $ 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything . 
player $ pos $ well , it was nice while it lasted .

player $ neg $ as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale . 
player $ neg $ only used for 3 month before it 's down ! 
picture $ neg $ it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment . 
color $ neg $ the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated . 
unit $ neg $ the entire unit was poorly crafted . 
screw tip $ neg $ there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board . 
dvd $ neg $ after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .

no disc $ neg $ it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .

player $ neg $ i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed ! 
customer service $ neg $ they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .

no disc $ neg $ less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows " no disc . " 
service $ neg $ same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing . 
format $ pos $ i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper . 
aff $ pos $ the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal . 
design $ pos $ loved the slim design . 
color signal $ neg $ this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared . 
customer service $ neg $ apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .

media $ pos $ it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! 
user interface $ pos $ i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds . 
player $ pos $ i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player . 
look $ pos $ and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! 
remote control $ neg $ one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does . 
shipping $ pos $ finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! 
player $ neg $ i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .

player $ pos $ for the most part this is a good dvd player .

picture $ neg $ there was neither picture nor sound . 
product $ pos $ we are overall pleased with product . 
manual $ neg $ i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .

support $ neg $ i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal . 
support $ neg $ neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . ) 
dvd $ neg $ it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen . 
progressive scan player $ pos $ progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) . 
dvd $ pos $ seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .

picture $ neg $ when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !

noise $ neg $ there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
